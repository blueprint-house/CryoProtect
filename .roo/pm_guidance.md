# Project Manager Guidance for CryoProtect v2 Completion

As the main Project Manager, I'll provide clear direction for completing the CryoProtect v2 project efficiently using Roo's boomerang capabilities.

## Core Principles for Efficient Execution

1. **Focused Tasks**: Each boomerang task addresses a single, well-defined unit of work
2. **Appropriate Context**: Include only essential context for each specialized agent
3. **Clear Validation Criteria**: Define exactly what "done" looks like
4. **Sequential Dependencies**: Complete prerequisites before dependent tasks
5. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tasks concurrently

## Current Status Assessment

Based on codebase analysis, the project is approximately 35-40% complete:
- Database Module: ‚úÖ 100% complete
- Testing Framework: ‚è≥ 75% complete (API fixtures done, Test Data in progress)
- API Standardization: üîÑ 10% complete (1 of ~10 resource files)
- Maintenance Utilities: üîÑ 30% complete
- Other components: Various stages of completion

## Phase 1 Implementation Guide

### API Standardization Track

**First Boomerang Task:**
```
@Backend I need you to standardize the api/resources.py file based on our established patterns.

Follow the same standards implemented in api/dashboard_resources.py:
1. Apply consistent error handling with handle_error
2. Add authentication with @token_required where appropriate
3. Use standardized response formatting with @marshal_with and field schemas
4. Ensure proper request validation
5. Add comprehensive docstrings

Update any affected tests to ensure they pass with your changes.
Document your changes by adding to README_API_FIXES.md.

Return the list of endpoints you've standardized and any notable challenges.
```

**Next Files in Sequence:**
1. `mixture_analysis_resources.py`
2. `rdkit_resources.py`
3. `predictive_models_resources.py`
4. Remaining resources in order of usage frequency

### Test Data Fixtures Track

**Parallel Boomerang Task:**
```
@QA I need you to continue implementing the Test Data Fixtures based on our current progress.

Tasks:
1. Complete the data generation utilities for molecules, mixtures, and experiments
2. Create standard test data JSON files in tests/fixtures/data/
3. Implement utility functions for retrieving and customizing test data
4. Write example tests demonstrating fixture usage
5. Add comprehensive documentation in README.md

Focus on maintaining consistency with our existing database fixtures.
Return a progress report and specify any blockers or dependencies.
```

## Validation Strategy

After each completed component:
1. Run relevant test suite to verify functionality
2. Check test coverage to ensure maintenance/improvement
3. Verify documentation has been updated
4. Review for adherence to established patterns

## Phase Transition Criteria

Before moving to Phase 2 (Core Infrastructure):
1. At least 60% of API resources standardized
2. Test Data Fixtures implementation complete
3. All tests passing across the codebase

## Progress Tracking

Track completion status using the following metrics:
1. API Standardization: # of resources completed / total resources
2. Test Framework: % of components implemented and integrated
3. Documentation: % of components with updated documentation
4. Test Coverage: % of code covered by tests

## Handling Blockers

When a boomerang task encounters blockers:
1. Clearly identify the nature of the blocker
2. Determine if it can be addressed within the same agent mode
3. If not, create a specific boomerang task to address the blocker
4. Reschedule the original task once blocker is resolved

## Boosting Efficiency

To maximize cost-efficiency and effectiveness:
1. Maintain explicit task boundaries to avoid scope creep
2. Include only necessary context in each boomerang task
3. Use the most specialized agent mode for each task type
4. Validate each component immediately after completion
