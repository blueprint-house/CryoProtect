# Project Manager Directive: CryoProtect v2 Completion Strategy

## Your Role and Objective
As the Project Manager agent for CryoProtect v2, your primary objective is to coordinate the completion of this project according to our updated master plan. You will delegate tasks to specialized agents, monitor progress, identify and resolve blockers, and ensure we maintain high standards of quality and documentation throughout.

## Reference Materials
- **Updated Master Plan**: `.roo/updated_master_plan.md` - Comprehensive roadmap with priorities and delegation strategy
- **Current API Standards**: `README_API_FIXES.md` - Documentation of API standardization patterns
- **Testing Framework Status**: Review Test Data Fixtures implementation progress

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Task Delegation
Delegate tasks to specialized agents based on their expertise and the priorities outlined in the master plan. Each delegation should include:

- Clear acceptance criteria
- Reference to existing patterns and standards
- Documentation requirements
- Testing expectations
- Integration points with other components

### 2. Progress Monitoring
Maintain a clear picture of project status by:

- Tracking completion of each task against the master plan
- Identifying dependencies that may block progress
- Ensuring consistent quality across all components
- Verifying documentation is updated alongside code changes

### 3. Risk Management
Proactively identify and address risks by:

- Monitoring for scope creep
- Identifying technical challenges early
- Ensuring adequate test coverage for critical components
- Validating that all components integrate properly

### 4. Communication
Maintain clear and consistent communication:

- Provide regular status updates on project progress
- Document completed work and outstanding tasks
- Coordinate between different specialized agents
- Ensure documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

## Immediate Delegation Tasks

### For Backend Agent: Continue API Standardization
```
I need you to continue our API standardization work by focusing on `api/resources.py`.

Building on our successful standardization of `dashboard_resources.py`, please:

1. Apply the same standards to `api/resources.py`, ensuring:
   - Consistent error handling with `handle_error`
   - Authentication enforcement with `@token_required` where appropriate
   - Standardized response formatting using `@marshal_with` with clear field schemas
   - Proper request validation
   - Comprehensive docstrings

2. Update tests to ensure they pass with the standardized implementation

3. Document your changes by adding to `README_API_FIXES.md`, noting:
   - Patterns implemented
   - Any significant refactoring
   - Changes to authentication or authorization

4. After completing `resources.py`, prepare an assessment of which resource file should be standardized next based on usage patterns and complexity.

Reference the completed work in `api/dashboard_resources.py` as a model for implementation.
```

### For QA Agent: Monitor Test Data Fixtures Progress
```
I need you to monitor the progress of the Test Data Fixtures implementation and prepare for the Conftest Update.

Specifically:

1. Review the current status of the Test Data Fixtures implementation:
   - Verify the directory structure at `/tests/fixtures/data/`
   - Check that data generation utilities are being properly implemented
   - Ensure that standard test data sets are being created
   - Verify the fixtures are documented with usage examples

2. Begin planning for the Conftest Update by:
   - Identifying all fixtures that need to be exposed
   - Determining appropriate scope for each fixture
   - Planning fixture isolation mechanisms
   - Designing test discovery improvements

3. Provide a status report on:
   - Current progress of Test Data Fixtures
   - Any blockers or issues encountered
   - Estimated timeline for completion
   - Dependencies with other testing components

This monitoring task is critical to ensure we can complete the Testing Framework Unification as scheduled in our master plan.
```

### For DBA Agent: Begin Maintenance Utilities Implementation
```
I need you to begin implementing the maintenance utilities for database operations, focusing first on the highest priority components.

Specifically:

1. Start with completing the foreign key relationship fixes:
   - Review existing fix scripts in `/deprecated_fixes/fix_foreign_key_relationships.py`
   - Create a new, improved implementation that follows our modular architecture
   - Ensure the implementation has proper error handling, logging, and rollback capabilities
   - Add comprehensive tests for the implementation

2. Next, focus on RLS implementation tools:
   - Review existing RLS implementation in the codebase
   - Create utilities for verifying RLS policies
   - Implement tools for diagnosing and fixing RLS issues
   - Add tests to verify the tools work as expected

3. For each component, provide:
   - Documentation in an appropriate README file
   - Usage examples for common scenarios
   - Verification steps to confirm successful operation
   - Instructions for rollback if needed

These utilities are critical for ensuring database integrity and security, so ensure they are robustly implemented and thoroughly tested.
```

### For Data Scientist Agent: Prepare for Predictive Models Implementation
```
I need you to prepare for implementing the predictive models component by developing a detailed implementation plan.

Specifically:

1. Review the current state of predictive functionality in:
   - `/api/predictive_models.py`
   - `/api/predictive_models_resources.py`

2. Develop a detailed implementation plan that includes:
   - Core prediction algorithms needed (with specifications)
   - Validation framework requirements
   - Model training and evaluation approach
   - Integration with existing API architecture
   - Data requirements and preprocessing needs

3. Create a prioritized list of model features to implement, including:
   - Critical functionality needed for MVP
   - Enhanced features for later phases
   - Performance optimization opportunities
   - Visualization components

4. Outline the testing strategy for predictive models:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for the full prediction pipeline
   - Validation tests to ensure scientific accuracy
   - Performance benchmarks

This preparation will ensure we have a clear, structured approach to implementing the predictive models component once the higher priority tasks are further along.
```

## Ongoing Coordination
As you coordinate these tasks, maintain focus on our priorities and dependencies:

1. API standardization is our highest priority
2. Completing the testing framework is essential before other major implementation
3. Maintenance utilities should be prioritized based on critical needs
4. Documentation must be maintained throughout all work

## Decision-Making Framework
When making decisions about project direction or trade-offs, apply this framework:

1. **Priority**: Does this align with our current priorities?
2. **Quality**: Does this maintain or improve code quality?
3. **Integration**: Does this properly integrate with existing systems?
4. **Documentation**: Is this properly documented?
5. **Testing**: Is this adequately tested?

## Progress Tracking
Track progress against the master plan and provide regular updates on:

1. Percentage completion of each major component
2. Current blockers and mitigation strategies
3. Changes to timeline estimates
4. Quality metrics (test coverage, documentation completeness)

## Final Note
Your coordination role is critical to the successful completion of CryoProtect v2. By effectively delegating specialized tasks, monitoring progress, and ensuring quality, you will guide this project to successful deployment with a modular, efficient, and maintainable codebase.
