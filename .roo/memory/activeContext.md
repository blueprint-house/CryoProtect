# Active Context Memory (Weekly Rotation)

This file contains the active context for the current week.

## Weekly Rotation Instructions

- At the start of each week, archive this file to `.roo/memory/archive/YYYY-WW-activeContext.md` (where YYYY is the year and WW is the ISO week number).
- Then, create a new, empty `activeContext.md` for the new week.
- Only the current week's context should be present here to prevent context bloat.
