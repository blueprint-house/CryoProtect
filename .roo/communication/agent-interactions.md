# Goal: Testing Framework Unification
# Task: API Fixtures Implementation - Delegate API Fixtures to QA Agent
Description: Delegated the implementation of the API Fixtures component for the testing framework unification project to the QA Agent. The agent is to follow the detailed plan in API_FIXTURES.md, create the directory structure at /tests/fixtures/api/, implement client.py, auth.py, and __init__.py with the specified fixtures, create example tests in /tests/unit/api/test_api_fixtures.py, and add documentation in README.md. The implementation must integrate with the existing Flask app structure and authentication methods, support both authenticated and unauthenticated testing, include fixtures for different user roles, provide JSON request/response handling, and include comprehensive documentation with usage examples. The Database Fixtures and Mock Objects components are already implemented and can be used as reference for style and integration patterns.

# Goal: Testing Framework Unification
# Task: Test Data Fixtures Implementation - Delegate Test Data Fixtures to Data Scientist Agent
Description: API Fixtures component implementation is complete. Delegating the implementation of the Test Data Fixtures component for the testing framework unification project to the Data Scientist Agent. The agent is to follow the detailed plan in TEST_DATA_FIXTURES.md, create the directory structure at /tests/fixtures/data/, implement data generation utilities for all entity types, create standard test data sets for molecules, mixtures, experiments, etc., and add comprehensive documentation with usage examples. The implementation should focus on creating realistic test data, providing flexible data generation utilities, supporting both simple and complex test scenarios, ensuring consistent data relationships, and documenting the test data schema. The Database Fixtures, Mock Objects, and API Fixtures components are already implemented and can be referenced for integration patterns.

Description: Test Data Fixtures component implementation is complete. Delegating the implementation of the Conftest Update component for the testing framework unification project to the QA Agent. The agent is to follow the detailed plan in CONFTEST_UPDATE.md, update /tests/conftest.py to import and expose all fixtures, add pytest configuration options, ensure proper fixture isolation and scope, implement test discovery improvements, and add documentation for pytest options. This is the final integration step that brings together all the testing framework components: Database Fixtures, Mock Objects, API Fixtures, and Test Data Fixtures. The update should ensure all components work together seamlessly while maintaining proper isolation.

# Goal: Testing Framework Unification
# Task: Debug and Complete Example API Fixture Tests
Description: The example API fixture tests in tests/unit/api/test_api_fixtures.py are not all passing. Remaining issues include: (1) test_scientist_endpoint_as_scientist returns 403 instead of 200, (2) test_mock_api_client has an AttributeError on 'post', (3) TestFlaskAppIntegration methods have TypeErrors due to incorrect APIClient instantiation. These issues need to be debugged and resolved so that all example tests for the unified testing framework pass, as required by the unification plan.
