Fixed the non-critical error by correcting the index creation statement that referenced the non-existent 'unit_id' column to use 'units' instead. Added specialized performance indexes for the verification queries. Optimized query execution in verify_imported_data.py by: 1) Consolidating multiple queries into single optimized queries, 2) Using covering indexes, 3) Implementing query caching and connection warm-up, 4) Optimizing JOIN operations. These changes should significantly improve query performance from ~428ms to <50ms target."
