# Security Audit Gap Analysis (2025-04-25)

## Overview
This document analyzes the gaps between the current security audit (reports/security/security_audit_report_20250425_033852.json) and the requirements outlined in PHASE_3.3_IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVE.md and PHASE_3.3_TASK_PRIORITIZATION.md.

## 1. Audit Coverage vs. Requirements

| Area                        | Covered in Audit | Required by Directive | Notes |
|-----------------------------|:---------------:|:---------------------:|-------|
| Authentication (JWT, RBAC)  | Yes             | Yes                  | Only basic checks performed |
| API Endpoint Security       | Partial         | Yes                  | CSRF only warned, input validation/rate limiting pass, no penetration testing |
| Data Protection (RLS, Access Controls) | Yes | Yes | Encryption at rest only warned, not verified |
| Vulnerability Scanning      | No              | Yes                  | Not addressed in audit |
| Security Headers            | No              | Yes                  | Not addressed in audit |
| Cookie Security             | No              | Yes                  | Not addressed in audit |
| Secure Coding Practices     | No              | Yes                  | Not addressed in audit |
| Penetration Testing         | No              | Yes                  | Not addressed in audit |
| Risk Assessment/Severity Framework | Minimal   | Yes                  | Only basic severity, no structured risk assessment |
| Remediation Plan Framework  | No              | Yes                  | No actionable remediation plans provided |

## 2. Methodological Gaps

- No evidence of automated or manual penetration testing.
- No vulnerability scanning of dependencies or runtime environment.
- No verification of security headers or cookie attributes.
- No secure coding practice validation.
- No structured risk assessment or prioritization of findings.
- No actionable remediation plans or assignment of responsibility.

## 3. Unaddressed Critical/High Risks

- **CSRF Protection**: Only a warning; must be implemented for all state-changing endpoints.
- **Encryption at Rest**: High severity warning; must be verified and implemented for all sensitive data.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Absent; must be integrated into CI/CD and runtime.
- **Security Headers**: Absent; must be implemented via middleware.
- **Cookie Security**: Absent; must be implemented for all session and sensitive cookies.
- **Penetration Testing**: Not performed; must be scheduled after other remediations.
- **Risk Assessment**: No structured risk or severity framework; must be added.

## 4. Recommendations

- Refine audit methodology to include all required areas.
- Implement missing security controls and verification steps.
- Establish a structured risk assessment and remediation plan framework.
