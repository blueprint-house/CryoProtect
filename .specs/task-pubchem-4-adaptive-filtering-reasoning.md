# Adaptive Filtering and Compound Quality Scoring System - Reasoning Document

**Task ID:** task-pubchem-4-adaptive-filtering  
**Author:** Solution Architect  
**Date:** 2025-04-28

## 1. Requirements Summary

Design and specify an adaptive filtering and compound quality scoring system for PubChem import that includes:

- Progressive criteria relaxation for filtering compounds
- Quality scoring mechanism to prioritize high-quality compounds
- Integration with existing PubChem import components (cache, chunked processing, RDKit fallback)
- Implementation in `pubchem/filtering.py` and `pubchem/quality_scoring.py`

## 2. Component Breakdown

The system can be logically divided into these components:

1. **Filtering Criteria Definition**: Define molecular property criteria for filtering compounds
2. **Adaptive Filtering Engine**: Progressively relax filtering criteria based on success rates
3. **Quality Scoring System**: Score compounds based on data completeness, property values, and relevance
4. **Integration Layer**: Connect with existing PubChem client, cache, and chunked processing

## 3. Challenges & Constraints

1. **Balancing Quantity vs. Quality**:
   - Strict filtering criteria may result in too few compounds
   - Relaxed criteria may include low-quality or irrelevant compounds
   - Need to find optimal balance through adaptive approach

2. **Defining Relevance**:
   - Determining which compounds are relevant for cryoprotection
   - May require domain-specific knowledge or heuristics
   - Need flexible scoring system that can be adjusted based on research focus

3. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - PubChem data may be incomplete for many compounds
   - Need to decide whether to filter out compounds with missing data or score them lower
   - RDKit fallback can help but may not provide all missing properties

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Filtering and scoring must be efficient to handle large datasets
   - Should not significantly slow down the import process
   - Need to balance computational cost with filtering/scoring sophistication

5. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - Must work seamlessly with the cache system, chunked processing, and RDKit fallback
   - Should respect the circuit breaker pattern and adaptive chunk sizing

## 4. Solution Approaches

### Approach A: Static Filtering with Binary Decisions

- Define fixed criteria for accepting/rejecting compounds
- Simple implementation with clear rules
- Disadvantage: Inflexible, may reject too many compounds or accept too many low-quality ones

### Approach B: Multi-Level Filtering with Progressive Relaxation

- Define multiple tiers of filtering criteria (strict, moderate, relaxed)
- Start with strict criteria, progressively relax if not enough compounds pass
- Advantage: Balances quality and quantity
- Disadvantage: More complex implementation, requires careful threshold definition

### Approach C: Continuous Scoring with Threshold Adaptation

- Score each compound on a continuous scale (0-100)
- Dynamically adjust acceptance threshold based on overall distribution
- Advantage: Most flexible, can adapt to any dataset
- Disadvantage: More complex, may be harder to explain/justify filtering decisions

## 5. Decision & Rationale

**Selected Approach: B (Multi-Level Filtering with Progressive Relaxation) combined with elements of C (Continuous Scoring)**

Rationale:
- Provides clear filtering tiers that can be progressively relaxed
- Includes a continuous quality score for prioritization within each tier
- Allows for both filtering (binary decision) and ranking (continuous score)
- Can adapt to different datasets and research focuses
- Provides transparency in filtering decisions

This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds: clear filtering rules that can be progressively relaxed (Approach B) and a continuous quality score that can be used for prioritization and threshold adaptation (Approach C).

## 6. Implementation Considerations

1. **Filtering Criteria Definition**:
   - Define 3-4 tiers of filtering criteria (strict, moderate, relaxed, minimal)
   - Include molecular properties relevant to cryoprotection (e.g., LogP, TPSA, H-Bond donors/acceptors)
   - Allow for customization of criteria through configuration

2. **Quality Scoring Algorithm**:
   - Develop a weighted scoring system (0-100) based on multiple factors
   - Include data completeness, property values, and relevance to cryoprotection
   - Allow for customization of weights through configuration

3. **Adaptive Mechanism**:
   - Monitor filtering success rate (compounds passing filter / total compounds)
   - Automatically relax criteria if success rate falls below target threshold
   - Include circuit breaker to prevent excessive relaxation

4. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Integrate with chunked processing to filter compounds in batches
   - Use cache to store filtering results and quality scores
   - Leverage RDKit fallback for missing properties before filtering

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement efficient filtering algorithms
   - Cache filtering results to avoid redundant calculations
   - Use batch processing for scoring and filtering
