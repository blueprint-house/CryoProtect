# Security Audit Remediation Plan (2025-04-25)

## Overview
This document provides actionable remediation steps for all critical and high-severity issues and gaps identified in the Security Audit Gap Analysis (2025-04-25). It also recommends refinements to the audit methodology to ensure comprehensive security coverage.

## 1. Remediation Actions

### 1.1 CSRF Protection (Critical)
- **Action:** Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing API endpoints.
- **Responsible:** Backend/API team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE endpoints require and validate CSRF tokens; automated tests verify CSRF protection.

### 1.2 Encryption at Rest (Critical)
- **Action:** Verify and implement encryption for all sensitive data at rest (database fields, files, backups).
- **Responsible:** Backend/Database team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All sensitive fields are encrypted using strong algorithms; key management and rotation are documented and tested.

### 1.3 Vulnerability Scanning (High)
- **Action:** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning (Bandit, Safety, OWASP Dependency-Check, ESLint security plugins) into CI/CD and runtime.
- **Responsible:** DevOps/Security team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** CI/CD pipelines fail on critical vulnerabilities; daily/weekly runtime scans with alerting; scan results are reviewed and remediated.

### 1.4 Security Headers (High)
- **Action:** Implement security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Feature-Policy).
- **Responsible:** Backend/API team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All HTTP responses include required security headers; verified by automated tests and external scanners.

### 1.5 Cookie Security (High)
- **Action:** Implement secure cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) and session cookie rotation.
- **Responsible:** Backend/API team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All session and sensitive cookies have proper attributes; session rotation is tested; verified by automated and manual tests.

### 1.6 Penetration Testing (High)
- **Action:** Schedule and conduct manual and automated penetration testing after remediation of above issues.
- **Responsible:** Security team / External auditors
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All critical/high issues identified in penetration testing are remediated; final report is documented.

### 1.7 Risk Assessment & Remediation Framework (High)
- **Action:** Establish a structured risk assessment methodology and remediation plan framework in audit reports.
- **Responsible:** Security/Compliance team
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All findings are classified by risk/severity; remediation owners and deadlines are assigned; progress is tracked.

### 1.8 Secure Coding Practices (Medium)
- **Action:** Validate codebase for secure coding practices (input validation, error handling, least privilege, etc.).
- **Responsible:** All development teams
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Secure coding checklist is applied to all code; issues are tracked and remediated.

## 2. Methodology Refinements

- Expand audit script to include:
  - Vulnerability scanning of dependencies and runtime.
  - Security headers and cookie attribute verification.
  - Secure coding practice validation.
  - Penetration testing (manual/automated).
  - Structured risk assessment and remediation tracking.
