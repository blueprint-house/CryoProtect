## 1. RLS Effectiveness Testing

### 1.1 Overview

Row Level Security (RLS) is a critical security feature that restricts which rows a user can access in a database table. This section evaluates the effectiveness of RLS policies implemented in the CryoProtect v2 database.

### 1.2 Test Methodology

The following tests were performed to assess RLS effectiveness:

1. **Bypass Attempts:** Direct SQL queries attempting to bypass RLS restrictions
2. **Policy Verification:** Verification of policy definitions and their application
3. **Edge Case Testing:** Testing of edge cases and potential security loopholes

### 1.3 Results

#### 1.3.1 Bypass Attempts

| Table | Test | Result | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| molecules | Anonymous access to private data | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |
| mixtures | Anonymous access to private data | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |
| experiments | Anonymous access to private data | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |
| predictions | Anonymous access to private data | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |

#### 1.3.2 Policy Verification

| Table | Policy | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior | Status |
|-------|--------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| molecules | molecules_public_read_policy | Allow read access to public molecules | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| molecules | molecules_owner_policy | Allow full access to owned molecules | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| mixtures | mixtures_public_read_policy | Allow read access to public mixtures | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| experiments | experiments_owner_policy | Allow full access to owned experiments | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |

#### 1.3.3 Edge Case Testing

| Test Case | Description | Result | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Null values | Testing RLS with null values in key fields | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |
| Empty strings | Testing RLS with empty strings | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |
| Special characters | Testing RLS with special characters | [RESULT] | [NOTES] |

## 2. Access Control Validation

### 2.1 Overview

This section evaluates the access control mechanisms implemented in the CryoProtect v2 database, focusing on different user roles and their permissions.

### 2.2 Test Methodology

The following user roles were tested:

1. **Anonymous (anon):** Unauthenticated users
2. **Authenticated:** Regular authenticated users
3. **Service Role:** Backend service role with elevated privileges

For each role, we tested:
- Read access to public and private data
- Write/update/delete permissions
- Access to related records

### 2.3 Results

#### 2.3.1 Anonymous User Access

| Resource | Operation | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Public molecules | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Private molecules | Read | Deny | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Any molecule | Write | Deny | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Public mixtures | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |

#### 2.3.2 Authenticated User Access

| Resource | Operation | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Public molecules | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Private molecules (owned) | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Private molecules (not owned) | Read | Deny | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Own molecules | Write | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| Other's molecules | Write | Deny | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |

#### 2.3.3 Service Role Access

| Resource | Operation | Expected | Actual | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| All molecules | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| All mixtures | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| All experiments | Read | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |
| All resources | Write | Allow | [ACTUAL] | [STATUS] |

## 3. Performance Impact Assessment

### 3.1 Overview

This section evaluates the performance impact of RLS policies on query execution time.

### 3.2 Test Methodology

We measured query execution times with and without RLS enabled for various operations:
- Simple SELECT queries
- Complex JOIN queries
- Filtered queries with WHERE clauses

Each test was run multiple times to ensure statistical significance.

### 3.3 Results

#### 3.3.1 Query Execution Times (milliseconds)

| Query Type | With RLS | Without RLS | Difference | Impact % |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Simple SELECT | [TIME] | [TIME] | [DIFF] | [IMPACT] |
| Complex JOIN | [TIME] | [TIME] | [DIFF] | [IMPACT] |
| Filtered WHERE | [TIME] | [TIME] | [DIFF] | [IMPACT] |

#### 3.3.2 Performance Impact by Table

| Table | Average Impact % | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| molecules | [IMPACT] | [NOTES] |
| mixtures | [IMPACT] | [NOTES] |
| experiments | [IMPACT] | [NOTES] |
| predictions | [IMPACT] | [NOTES] |
