# CryoProtect v2 RLS Policies Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation and verification of Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for the CryoProtect v2 Supabase database. The implementation was performed on April 22, 2025, using the Supabase MCP server.

## Implementation Summary

The following security features were successfully implemented:

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)** was enabled on 8 tables:
   - molecules
   - mixtures
   - experiments
   - molecular_properties
   - mixture_components
   - experiment_properties
   - migrations
   - scientific_data_audit

2. **SECURITY INVOKER** was set on 3 views:
   - molecule_with_properties
   - mixture_with_components
   - experiment_with_results

3. **Performance Indexes** were created for RLS policy optimization:
   - idx_user_profile_team_id
   - idx_user_profile_auth_user_id
   - idx_experiments_project_id
   - idx_mixtures_project_id
   - idx_molecular_properties_molecule_id
   - idx_experiment_properties_experiment_id
   - idx_mixture_components_mixture_id

4. **Audit Triggers** were implemented for scientific data tables:
   - audit_molecules_trigger
   - audit_mixtures_trigger
   - audit_experiments_trigger

## RLS Policies

A total of 41 RLS policies were implemented across the 8 tables:

| Table | Policies | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| molecules | 7 | Service role access, public/private data access control |
| mixtures | 7 | Service role access, project-based access control |
| experiments | 8 | Service role access, project-based access control |
| molecular_properties | 6 | Service role access, parent-based access control |
| mixture_components | 6 | Service role access, parent-based access control |
| experiment_properties | 2 | Service role access, parent-based access control |
| migrations | 2 | Service role and admin-only access |
| scientific_data_audit | 3 | Service role, admin, and user-specific access |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Table RLS Enablement

RLS was enabled on all required tables using:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.[table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. View Security

All views were recreated with SECURITY INVOKER to ensure they respect the underlying table policies:
```sql
CREATE VIEW public.[view_name] WITH (security_invoker=true) AS
SELECT ...
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

Performance indexes were created to optimize RLS policy evaluation:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_[table]_[column] ON [table]([column]);
```

### 4. Audit Trail

An audit system was implemented to track changes to scientific data:
- Created scientific_data_audit table
- Implemented audit_scientific_data() trigger function
- Applied triggers to key scientific data tables

## Verification Results

The implementation was verified using a custom verification function that confirmed:

- All 8 tables have RLS enabled with appropriate policies
- All 3 views have SECURITY INVOKER set correctly
- All 6 RLS-specific performance indexes are in place
- All 3 scientific data audit triggers are in place

A detailed JSON verification report is available in `rls_verification_report.json`.

## Conclusion

The implementation of RLS policies for the CryoProtect v2 Supabase database has been successfully completed and verified. The database now enforces proper access control at the row level, ensuring data security and privacy while maintaining performance through optimized indexes.
