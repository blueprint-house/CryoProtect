## Data Integrity

- All data was successfully inserted without errors
- Proper relationships were maintained between tables
- All required scientific data is now available in the database

## RLS Compatibility

The data was inserted using the service role, which bypasses RLS policies. All data should be accessible through the appropriate RLS policies that were previously set up in the database.

## Conclusion

The CryoProtect v2 Supabase database has been successfully populated with the required scientific data. The database is now ready for use by the application.
