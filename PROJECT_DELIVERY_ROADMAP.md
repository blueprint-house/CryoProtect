   - Feature documentation
   - API documentation

2. Operations Documentation
   - System architecture documentation
   - Operational procedures
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. Developer Documentation
   - Code organization documentation
   - Development setup guidelines
   - Contribution guidelines

4. Knowledge Transfer
   - Training sessions
   - Handover documentation
   - Final delivery

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for project completion involves:

1. **Deployment Infrastructure â†’ Monitoring â†’ Security â†’ Knowledge Transfer**

Critical dependencies include:
- CI/CD pipeline implementation must be completed before monitoring integration
- Monitoring system must be in place before security audit
- Security implementation must be completed before final documentation

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Supabase connection issues persist | High | Medium | Fully implement and test local database fallback |
| CI/CD integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Prepare manual deployment procedures as backup |
| Security vulnerabilities discovered | High | Low | Schedule additional time for remediation work |
| Knowledge transfer gaps | Medium | Low | Create comprehensive documentation and Q&A sessions |

## Success Metrics

The project will be considered successful when:

1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Test coverage: 90%+
   - API response time: <500ms for 95th percentile
   - Deployment time: <15 minutes
   - Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities

2. **User Metrics**
   - All features functional in production environment
   - User workflow completion time reduced by 40%+
   - Data accuracy verified at 99%+

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - System uptime: 99.9%+
   - Automated recovery from common failures
   - Complete monitoring coverage
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Communication Plan

| Stakeholder | Communication Method | Frequency | Content |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------|---------|
