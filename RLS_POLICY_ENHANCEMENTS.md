# CryoProtect v2 RLS Policy Enhancements

This document describes the Row Level Security (RLS) policy enhancements implemented for the CryoProtect v2 database based on the recommendations from the RLS Audit Report.

## Overview

The RLS policy enhancements address the following issues identified in the audit report:

1. Tables with RLS disabled but policies defined
2. Tables with RLS enabled but missing expected policies
3. Tables with RLS disabled and no policies defined
4. Inconsistent policy implementation across tables
5. Missing public access policies

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Enabled RLS on All Tables

RLS has been enabled on the following tables that previously had it disabled:

- `calculation_methods`
- `predictions`
- `projects`
- `property_types`
- `teams`
- `user_profile`

This ensures consistent security enforcement across the entire database.

### 2. Completed Missing Policies

Added missing policies to tables with incomplete policy sets:

- Added DELETE and UPDATE policies to `experiment_properties`
- Added service role policies to `mixture_components`, `mixtures`, `molecular_properties`, `molecules`
- Added complete policy sets to `molecule_experiments`, `molecule_proteins`, `proteins`

### 3. Implemented Public Access Policies

Added policies to allow public read access based on the `is_public` flag for:

- `molecules`
- `mixtures`
- `experiments`

These policies allow anyone to view records marked as public, even if they are not authenticated or not members of the associated project.

### 4. Added Basic Policies for Projects Table

Implemented a complete set of policies for the `projects` table:

- SELECT policy for project members
- INSERT policy for authenticated users
- UPDATE policy for project members
- DELETE policy for project owners

### 5. Added Data Classification Policies

Implemented data classification-based policies for sensitive scientific data:

- Added a policy to restrict access to sensitive molecular data based on user clearance levels

### 6. Standardized Policy Implementation

Standardized the policy implementation across all tables:

- Used consistent naming conventions for policies
- Implemented consistent role-based restrictions for sensitive operations
- Ensured all tables have the same level of protection for equivalent operations

## Verification

A verification script has been included to check that all RLS policies have been correctly implemented. The script generates a report in the `reports/security` directory that shows:

- RLS status for all tables
- Policy count for each table
- Detailed policy information

## Usage

To apply these RLS policy enhancements:

### On Unix-like Systems (Linux, macOS)

```bash
./implement_enhanced_rls_policies.sh
```

### On Windows

```cmd
implement_enhanced_rls_policies.bat
```

You can also specify a custom Supabase project ID:

```bash
./implement_enhanced_rls_policies.sh --project-id your-project-id
```

```cmd
implement_enhanced_rls_policies.bat --project-id your-project-id
```

## Benefits

These RLS policy enhancements provide the following benefits:

1. **Consistent Security Model**: All tables now have RLS enabled with appropriate policies.
2. **Granular Access Control**: Access is controlled based on project membership, user roles, and data sensitivity.
3. **Public Data Sharing**: Public data can be shared without compromising security.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Policies are implemented with performance considerations.
5. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All changes to sensitive scientific data are tracked.

## Conclusion

The implemented RLS policy enhancements significantly improve the security posture of the CryoProtect v2 database, ensuring that sensitive scientific data is properly protected while still allowing appropriate access for collaboration and research.
