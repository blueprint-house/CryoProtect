## Authentication Workflows

### Login Flow

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. User navigates to the login page (`/login`)
2. User is presented with login options:
   - Social login (Google, GitHub)
   - Email/password login
3. User enters credentials or selects social login
4. System validates credentials
5. If MFA is required, user is prompted for MFA code
6. On successful authentication:
   - User session is created
   - User profile is synced with backend
   - User is redirected to the dashboard
7. On failed authentication:
   - Error message is displayed
   - User remains on login page

#### Workflow Diagram

    A[User navigates to login page] --> B[View login options]
    B --> C1[Choose social login]
    B --> C2[Enter email/password]
    C1 --> D1[Redirect to provider]
    D1 --> E1[Provider authentication]
    E1 --> F[Validate credentials]
    C2 --> F
    F --> G{Valid credentials?}
    G -- No --> H[Display error message]
    H --> B
    G -- Yes --> I{MFA required?}
    I -- Yes --> J[Prompt for MFA code]
    J --> K[Validate MFA]
    K --> L{Valid MFA?}
    L -- No --> M[Display MFA error]
    M --> J
    L -- Yes --> N[Create session]
    I -- No --> N
    N --> O[Sync user profile]
    O --> P[Redirect to dashboard]
```

#### Pain Points and Bottlenecks

1. **MFA Implementation Complexity**: The multi-factor authentication flow adds complexity and an additional step that might confuse users.
2. **Social Login Redirect**: The social login process involves a redirect to the provider and back, which can be disorienting for users.
3. **Error Handling**: Error messages are displayed inline but might not be immediately visible if the form is long.
4. **Session Management**: The session token is stored in localStorage, which has security implications.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Streamlined MFA**: Implement a more streamlined MFA process with clearer instructions and visual cues.
2. **Persistent Login State**: Add a "Remember me" option to extend session duration for trusted devices.
3. **Enhanced Error Visibility**: Make error messages more prominent and provide more specific guidance on how to resolve issues.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Consider using HttpOnly cookies for session storage instead of localStorage for better security.
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement a progressive enhancement approach for the login form to work without JavaScript.

### Registration Flow

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. User navigates to the registration page (`/register`)
2. User enters email, password, and confirms password
3. System validates input:
   - Checks if passwords match
   - Ensures password meets minimum length requirement (8 characters)
4. On successful validation:
   - User account is created
   - If email confirmation is required, user is notified to check email
   - If no confirmation is required, user is automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard
5. On validation failure:
   - Error message is displayed
   - User remains on registration page

#### Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User navigates to registration page] --> B[Enter email and password]
    B --> C[Validate input]
    C --> D{Valid input?}
    D -- No --> E[Display error message]
    E --> B
    D -- Yes --> F[Create user account]
    F --> G{Email confirmation required?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Display confirmation message]
    G -- No --> I[Create session]
    I --> J[Sync user profile]
    J --> K[Redirect to dashboard]
```

#### Pain Points and Bottlenecks

1. **Limited Password Requirements**: The password validation only checks for minimum length, not complexity.
2. **No Password Strength Indicator**: Users have no visual feedback on password strength.
3. **Email Verification Uncertainty**: Users may be confused about whether email verification is required.
4. **Limited Social Registration**: Unlike login, there are no social registration options.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Enhanced Password Requirements**: Implement stronger password requirements with a visual strength meter.
2. **Social Registration**: Add social registration options to match the login options.
3. **Clear Verification Instructions**: Provide clearer instructions about the email verification process.
4. **Progressive Form Validation**: Implement real-time validation feedback as users type.
5. **Guided Registration**: Consider a step-by-step registration process for collecting additional profile information.

### Password Reset Flow

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. User navigates to the password reset page (`/reset-password`)
2. User enters their email address
3. System sends a password reset link to the provided email
4. User receives email and clicks the reset link
5. User is directed back to the application with a token in the URL
6. User enters new password and confirms it
7. System validates the new password
8. On successful validation:
   - Password is updated
   - Success message is displayed
   - User is redirected to login page
9. On validation failure:
   - Error message is displayed
   - User remains on reset password page

#### Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User navigates to reset password page] --> B[Enter email address]
    B --> C[Submit reset request]
    C --> D[System sends reset email]
    D --> E[User clicks reset link in email]
    E --> F[User enters new password]
    F --> G[Validate new password]
    G --> H{Valid password?}
    H -- No --> I[Display error message]
    I --> F
    H -- Yes --> J[Update password]
    J --> K[Display success message]
    K --> L[Redirect to login page]
```

#### Pain Points and Bottlenecks

1. **Email Dependency**: The process relies on email delivery, which can be delayed or fail.
2. **Token Expiration**: The reset token may expire before the user completes the process.
3. **Limited Context**: Users arriving from email may lack context about what they're doing.
4. **Same Password Validation**: There's no check to prevent users from reusing their old password.

#### Improvement Suggestions

1. **Alternative Recovery Methods**: Offer alternative recovery methods like SMS or security questions.
2. **Clear Token Expiration**: Clearly communicate how long the reset link is valid.
3. **Contextual Guidance**: Provide clear context and instructions when users arrive from reset emails.
4. **Prevent Password Reuse**: Implement checks to prevent users from reusing recent passwords.
5. **Streamlined Process**: Consider a more streamlined process with fewer steps.
