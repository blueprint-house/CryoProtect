# Phase 1.3: Database Architecture â€“ Code Cleanup Tasks

This document organizes all code cleanup and refactoring actions required for Phase 1.3 (Database Architecture) of the CryoProtect v2 project, as specified in the project plan.

## 1. RLS (Row-Level Security) Implementation Cleanup

- Review and refactor existing RLS policy code for clarity, maintainability, and performance.
- Remove redundant or obsolete RLS rules and ensure consistent naming conventions.
- Document all RLS policies, including rationale and usage examples.
- Create or update automated tests for RLS policies to verify correct enforcement and performance.

## 2. Connection Pooling Cleanup

- Audit connection pooling code for potential leaks, redundant logic, or outdated patterns.
- Refactor connection pool configuration for clarity and environment-specific tuning.
- Add or update documentation for connection pooling setup and tuning.
- Implement or improve health monitoring and logging for connection pool status.

## 3. Migration Framework Cleanup

- Review and refactor migration scripts for consistency, idempotency, and clarity.
- Remove deprecated or unused migration files.
- Standardize migration naming and documentation.
- Implement or update migration verification tools/scripts.
- Document migration and rollback procedures.

## 4. Data Integrity Verification Cleanup

- Audit and refactor data validation scripts and triggers for maintainability and coverage.
- Remove obsolete integrity checks and ensure all critical constraints are enforced.
- Standardize and document data integrity requirements and verification processes.
- Create or update automated scripts for data validation and reporting.

## General Cleanup Actions (across all areas)

- Ensure all database-related code follows project coding standards and best practices.
- Remove dead code, unused files, and outdated documentation related to database architecture.
- Update or create documentation for all changes, including rationale and usage instructions.
- Ensure all cleanup actions are covered by tests where applicable.

**Dependencies:**  
- Confirm that general code cleanup from Phase 1.1 is complete, and address any database-specific cleanup not previously covered.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- All code and configuration related to database architecture is clean, well-documented, and maintainable.
- Automated tests and verification scripts are in place and passing.
- Documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive for all database architecture components.
