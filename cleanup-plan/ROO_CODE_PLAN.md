# CryoProtect Project - Roo Code Implementation Plan

This document outlines a structured plan for implementing CryoProtect cleanup and completion tasks using Roo Code in Boomerang mode with a project manager agent.

## Project Manager Agent Configuration

To optimize for Boomerang mode:

```json
{
  "name": "CryoProtect PM",
  "description": "Project Manager for CryoProtect cleanup and implementation",
  "goal": "Systematically clean up and complete the CryoProtect project through sequential subtasks",
  "first_message": "I'll help you implement the CryoProtect cleanup plan by breaking it down into manageable sequential subtasks. Let's start with Phase 1: Critical Cleanup.",
  "approach": "Each subtask will be defined with a clear objective, acceptance criteria, and implementation details for Roo Code to execute."
}
```

## Task Structure for Boomerang Mode

Each task should follow this structure for optimal agent processing:

```
# Task: [Task Name]

## Phased Implementation Plan for Roo Code

### Phase 1: Critical Cleanup

#### Task 1.1: Backup Files Removal

```
# Task: Remove Backup Files

## Objective
Remove all backup (.bak) files from the codebase and prevent future tracking.

## Context
Backup files are cluttering the repository and causing confusion. They should be removed and .gitignore updated to prevent future tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All *.bak* files are removed from git tracking
- .gitignore is updated to prevent future tracking of backup files
- No production code functionality is affected

## Implementation Steps
1. Use git rm to remove all .bak files identified in our analysis
2. Update .gitignore to include *.bak* pattern
3. Verify no critical files were accidentally removed

## Files to Modify
- .gitignore (add exclusion patterns)
- Remove all .bak files found in the repository

## Verification
Run `git status` to ensure no backup files are present and modified files are as expected.
```

#### Task 1.2: Team Models Consolidation

```
# Task: Consolidate Team Models

## Objective
Consolidate fragmented team model files into a single coherent module.

## Context
The team model functionality is split across 7 files creating confusion and maintenance difficulties.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All team model functionality exists in a single file
- No functionality is lost during consolidation
- Imports are updated in dependent files
- Redundant files are removed

## Implementation Steps
1. Verify that team_models_combined.py contains all functionality
2. Backup the original team_models.py
3. Replace team_models.py with team_models_combined.py
4. Test to ensure functionality is preserved
5. Remove redundant part files

## Files to Modify
- api/team_models.py
- api/team_resources.py (for import references)
- Remove: api/team_models_part2.py through api/team_models_part6.py

## Verification
Run the relevant team functionality tests to ensure no functionality is lost.
```

#### Task 1.3: Reports Organization

```
# Task: Organize Report Files

## Objective
Create a structured reports directory and organize all report files.

## Context
Report files are scattered throughout the codebase with timestamp suffixes. They need organization for better maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Structured reports directory created with appropriate subdirectories
- All report files moved to relevant directories
- .gitignore updated to exclude most report files
- Latest reports preserved for reference

## Implementation Steps
1. Create reports directory structure (api, rls, archives, etc.)
2. Move verification reports to appropriate directories
3. Keep latest reports as reference files
4. Update .gitignore to prevent tracking of archived reports

## Files to Modify
- Create reports directory structure
- Move all *_verification*.json files to appropriate directories
- .gitignore (add exclusion patterns)

## Verification
Check that reports are in their correct directories and git status shows appropriate changes.
```

```

## Boomerang Mode Sequencing Guidelines

For optimal results with the project manager agent in Boomerang mode:

1. **Complete one task before starting the next**: Let the agent fully complete each task before moving to the next

2. **Verify task completion**: Use the verification step to confirm each task was completed successfully

3. **Provide feedback on each completed task**: Give feedback to the agent about what worked well or needs adjustment

4. **Maintain context between sessions**: Reference previous task completions to help the agent maintain context

5. **Use checkpoints**: After completing major tasks or phases, create checkpoints to summarize progress

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure progress:

- **Tasks Completed**: Number of tasks successfully completed
- **Files Improved**: Count of files refactored or cleaned up
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests (aim for increase)
- **Codebase Size Reduction**: Lines of redundant code eliminated
- **Documentation Improvement**: Percentage of code/features with proper documentation
