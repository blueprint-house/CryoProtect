# Documentation Organization Plan

## Current Situation

There are over 120 README*.md files scattered throughout the repository, with no clear organization or navigation structure. This makes finding information extremely difficult.

## Recommended Structure

Create a structured documentation directory with clear categories:

```
docs/
├── README.md (main documentation entry point with navigation)
├── api/
│   ├── README.md (API overview)
│   ├── endpoints.md
│   ├── authentication.md
│   ├── integration.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── database/
│   ├── README.md (Database overview)
│   ├── schema.md
│   ├── relationships.md
│   ├── rls.md
│   ├── performance.md
│   └── migrations.md
├── deployment/
│   ├── README.md (Deployment overview)
│   ├── setup.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   └── monitoring.md
├── development/
│   ├── README.md (Development overview)
│   ├── environment.md
│   ├── testing.md
│   ├── style-guide.md
│   └── contributing.md
├── features/
│   ├── README.md (Features overview)
│   ├── molecules.md
│   ├── mixtures.md
│   ├── rdkit.md
│   ├── predictions.md
│   └── team-collaboration.md
└── operations/
    ├── README.md (Operations overview)
    ├── backup.md
    ├── maintenance.md
    └── troubleshooting.md
```

## Immediate Actions

1. Create the directory structure
2. Create a main documentation README with links to all sections
3. Gradually move content from existing README files to the appropriate location
4. Update cross-references in documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. First, create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p docs/database
mkdir -p docs/deployment
mkdir -p docs/development
mkdir -p docs/features
mkdir -p docs/operations
```

2. Create the main documentation README:

```markdown
# CryoProtect Analyzer Documentation

Welcome to the CryoProtect Analyzer documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about all aspects of the system.

## Table of Contents

- [API Documentation](api/README.md)
- [Database Documentation](database/README.md)
- [Deployment Guide](deployment/README.md)
- [Development Guide](development/README.md)
- [Feature Documentation](features/README.md)
- [Operations Guide](operations/README.md)

## Quick Start

For new users, we recommend starting with:

1. [Setting up your development environment](development/environment.md)
2. [Understanding the system architecture](development/architecture.md)
3. [Running your first analysis](features/quick-start.md)

## For Administrators

If you're administering the system, start with:

1. [Deployment Guide](deployment/README.md)
2. [Configuration Guide](deployment/configuration.md)
3. [Backup and Recovery](operations/backup.md)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to both the codebase and this documentation. See the [Contributing Guide](development/contributing.md) for details.
```

3. Create section README files for each category:

```bash
for dir in api database deployment development features operations; do
  echo "# CryoProtect Analyzer - ${dir^} Documentation\n\nThis section covers ${dir}-related documentation.\n\n## Contents\n\n" > docs/$dir/README.md
done
```

4. Document the migration process in the main README:

```markdown
## Documentation Migration

We are in the process of consolidating our documentation. If you can't find what you're looking for, check the old README files in the project root, which will gradually be migrated here.
```

## Commands for Setup

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p docs/database
mkdir -p docs/deployment
mkdir -p docs/development
mkdir -p docs/features
mkdir -p docs/operations

# Create placeholder README files for each section
for dir in api database deployment development features operations; do
  echo "# CryoProtect Analyzer - ${dir^} Documentation\n\nThis section covers ${dir}-related documentation.\n\n## Contents\n\n" > docs/$dir/README.md
done

# Create the main documentation README
cat > docs/README.md << 'EOF'
