      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into specific subtasks covering repository creation, version control configuration, build tool setup, coding standards implementation, package management, and development server configuration. Include specific tools and technologies to be used.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical components that need to be properly configured. While not algorithmically complex, it requires careful attention to detail and proper integration of various development tools. The foundation established here will impact all subsequent development."

      "taskTitle": "User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering user registration flow, login mechanism, password reset functionality, JWT/session implementation, role-based access control, and secure password storage. Include security considerations for each component.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication systems have moderate algorithmic complexity but high security implications. The task requires implementing multiple user flows and security mechanisms. Any vulnerabilities could compromise the entire application, making careful implementation critical."

      "taskTitle": "Advanced Feature Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the advanced feature implementation into subtasks covering notification system, user preferences management, advanced search functionality, reporting capabilities, and any specialized domain-specific features. Prioritize these features based on business value.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the diverse nature of the features and their potential interdependencies. Each advanced feature likely requires both frontend and backend components and may involve complex business logic or algorithms."

      "taskTitle": "Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the performance optimization task into subtasks covering server-side caching implementation, database query optimization, frontend bundle optimization, asset loading strategies, code splitting/lazy loading, and performance monitoring setup. Include measurement criteria for each optimization.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization requires deep technical knowledge across the stack. The complexity comes from identifying bottlenecks, implementing appropriate solutions, and measuring their impact. This often involves making tradeoffs between different performance aspects."
