# Technical Documentation

This section provides detailed technical documentation for the CryoProtect project, focusing on the various fixes and improvements implemented to address critical issues.

## Overview

The technical documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. [Database Schema Changes](./technical/database-schema-changes.md)
2. [Security Implementation](./technical/security-implementation.md)
3. [Relationship Design Fixes](./technical/relationship-design-fixes.md)
4. [API Integration Fixes](./technical/api-integration-fixes.md)

Each section provides in-depth information about the specific technical aspects of the project, including the issues identified, the solutions implemented, and the technical details of the implementation.

## System Architecture

CryoProtect is built on the following technology stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Molecular Analysis**: RDKit
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional)

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Web Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **API Layer**: Provides RESTful endpoints for data access
- **Service Layer**: Implements business logic
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions
- **Authentication Layer**: Handles user authentication and authorization

## Key Components

### Database

The database is hosted on Supabase and consists of multiple tables organized according to the domain model. Key tables include:

- `molecules`: Stores molecular data
- `mixtures`: Stores mixture compositions
- `mixture_components`: Junction table linking mixtures and molecules
- `predictions`: Stores prediction results
- `experiments`: Stores experiment data
- `experiment_properties`: Stores experiment property values
- `calculation_methods`: Stores information about calculation methods
- `property_types`: Stores property type definitions
- `projects`: Stores project information
- `teams`: Stores team information

### API

The API provides RESTful endpoints for accessing and manipulating data. Key endpoints include:

- `/molecules`: CRUD operations for molecules
- `/mixtures`: CRUD operations for mixtures
- `/predictions`: CRUD operations for predictions
- `/experiments`: CRUD operations for experiments
- `/auth`: Authentication operations

### Authentication

The authentication system is built on Supabase Auth and provides:

- User registration
- Login/logout
- Password reset
- Profile management
- Role-based access control

## Integration Points

CryoProtect integrates with several external systems:

1. **Supabase**: For database storage and authentication
2. **RDKit**: For molecular property calculations and visualization
3. **PubChem**: For retrieving molecular data (optional)

## Technical Debt

The following areas of technical debt have been addressed:

1. **Database Schema Inconsistencies**: Standardized table names and relationships
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implemented RLS policies and role-based access
3. **Relationship Design Flaws**: Fixed fan traps and normalized data structures
4. **API Integration Problems**: Fixed endpoint registration and JSON serialization
5. **Authentication Issues**: Implemented secure authentication flows

## Future Technical Considerations

Future technical enhancements could include:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization of database queries
2. **Scalability Improvements**: Implementing caching and load balancing
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Integration with machine learning models
4. **Real-time Collaboration**: Adding WebSocket support for real-time updates
5. **Mobile Support**: Developing a responsive mobile interface
