# Known Issues and Workarounds

## List of Issues

The following critical issues have been identified and addressed in the database:

1.  **SECURITY**: Row Level Security (RLS) was not enabled.
    *   RLS was not enabled on all tables.
    *   Anonymous access was not restricted.
    *   RLS policies were missing.
    *   RLS performance indexes were missing.

2.  **STRUCTURE**: The database schema was not standardized, and relationships were not properly defined.
    *   Table names were not in plural form.
    *   Foreign key references were outdated or incorrect.
    *   Fan traps existed due to missing junction tables.
    *   New junction tables were not secured.

3.  **PERFORMANCE**: Missing Indexes
    *   Foreign keys were not indexed.
    *   Specialized indexes for common queries were missing.

4.  **ROLES**: Application-Specific Roles were not defined.
    *   `app_readonly` role was missing.
    *   `app_readwrite` role was missing.
    *   SECURITY DEFINER functions were not implemented.

5.  **DATA**: Duplicate Tables
    *   Data was spread across duplicate tables.
    *   Table structures were not standardized.

## Mitigation

The database remediation process addresses these issues through the following steps:

1.  Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables, restrict anonymous access, create RLS policies, and add RLS performance indexes.
2.  Standardize table names to plural form, update foreign key references, create junction tables to fix fan traps, and secure new junction tables.
3.  Add missing indexes for foreign keys and common queries.
4.  Create application-specific roles (`app_readonly` and `app_readwrite`) and implement SECURITY DEFINER functions.
5.  Consolidate data from duplicate tables and standardize table structures.

## Roadmap

The remediation process is implemented in the `complete_database_remediation.py` script. The process can be tested in a safe environment using the `test_database_remediation.py` script and verified using the `verify_database_remediation.py` script.

## Impact Assessment

Addressing these issues improves the security, structure, performance, and maintainability of the database. It also ensures data consistency and reduces the risk of data breaches.
