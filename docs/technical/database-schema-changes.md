# Database Schema Changes

This document details the database schema changes implemented in the CryoProtect project to address various issues and improve the overall database design.

## Overview

The database schema standardization process focused on the following key areas:

1. Converting singular table names to plural
2. Ensuring proper UUID primary keys
3. Adding appropriate foreign key constraints
4. Implementing proper indexing

These changes were implemented using the `standardize_schema.py` script, which provides a comprehensive approach to schema standardization with built-in safety mechanisms.

## Table Name Standardization

### Singular to Plural Conversion

The following table name conversions were implemented:

| Original (Singular) | Standardized (Plural) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| molecule            | molecules              |
| mixture             | mixtures               |
| prediction          | predictions            |
| experiment          | experiments            |
| experiment_property | experiment_properties  |
| mixture_component   | mixture_components     |
| calculation_method  | calculation_methods    |
| property_type       | property_types         |
| project             | projects               |
| team                | teams                  |

This standardization ensures consistency across the database schema and follows modern database naming conventions.

## Primary Key Standardization

All tables were updated to use UUID as their primary key with the DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() constraint. This ensures:

1. Globally unique identifiers across the database
2. Improved security (non-sequential IDs)
3. Consistency in primary key types

Example implementation:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.molecules 
  ALTER COLUMN id SET DATA TYPE UUID USING (gen_random_uuid()),
  ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT gen_random_uuid();
```

## Foreign Key Constraints

Foreign key constraints were added to all tables to enforce referential integrity. This ensures that:

1. No orphaned records can exist in the database
2. Relationships between tables are properly enforced
3. Cascading deletes/updates work correctly

Example implementation:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.mixture_components
  ADD CONSTRAINT mixture_components_mixture_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (mixture_id) REFERENCES public.mixtures(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE public.mixture_components
  ADD CONSTRAINT mixture_components_molecule_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (molecule_id) REFERENCES public.molecules(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

## Indexing

Appropriate indexes were added to improve query performance:

1. Indexes on all foreign key columns
2. Indexes on frequently queried columns
3. Composite indexes for multi-column queries

Example implementation:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mixture_components_mixture_id 
  ON public.mixture_components(mixture_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_mixture_components_molecule_id 
  ON public.mixture_components(molecule_id);
```

## Migration Process

The schema standardization process followed these steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create migration tracking tables to record all operations
   - Backup existing data

2. **Execution**:
   - Create new plural tables with the same schema as the singular tables
   - Copy data from singular to plural tables
   - Add appropriate foreign key constraints and indexes
   - Update application code to reference the new plural table names

3. **Verification**:
   - Verify data integrity after migration
   - Test application functionality with the new schema

4. **Rollback (if needed)**:
   - Execute the "down" SQL for each applied operation in reverse order
   - Restore from backup if necessary

## Implementation Details

The schema standardization was implemented using the `standardize_schema.py` script, which:

1. Uses the Supabase MCP tools to execute SQL queries
2. Tracks all operations in the `schema_migration_operations` table
3. Updates the migration status in the `schema_migrations` table
4. Creates a detailed log file with all SQL operations executed

## Impact on Application Code

The schema changes required updates to the application code:

1. **API Endpoints**: Updated to reference the new plural table names
2. **SQL Queries**: Modified to use the new table names
3. **ORM Models**: Updated to reflect the new schema

## Verification and Testing

After the schema standardization, the following verification steps were performed:

1. **Data Integrity Checks**: Ensured all data was correctly migrated
2. **Foreign Key Validation**: Verified all foreign key constraints
3. **Application Testing**: Tested all application functionality

## Rollback Mechanism

The schema standardization includes a comprehensive rollback mechanism:

1. If any operation fails, the entire migration can be rolled back
2. The rollback process executes the "down" SQL for each applied operation in reverse order
3. All operations are tracked in the `schema_migration_operations` table
4. The migration status is updated in the `schema_migrations` table

## Conclusion

The database schema standardization has significantly improved the CryoProtect database design by:

1. Ensuring consistent naming conventions
2. Enforcing proper relationships between tables
3. Improving query performance through appropriate indexing
4. Providing a solid foundation for future development

These changes have addressed the identified issues and created a more robust and maintainable database schema.
