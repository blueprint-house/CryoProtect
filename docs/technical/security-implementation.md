# Security Implementation

This document details the comprehensive security implementation for the CryoProtect project, focusing on Row Level Security (RLS) policies and app-specific database roles.

## Overview

The security implementation addresses several key areas:

1. Enabling Row Level Security (RLS) on all public tables
2. Creating RLS policies for different access patterns
3. Implementing app-specific database roles with minimum permissions
4. Providing verification and rollback mechanisms

These security features were implemented using the `implement_security.py` script, which provides a comprehensive approach to security implementation with built-in safety mechanisms.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

### Enabling RLS

Row Level Security was enabled on all public tables to restrict access to data based on user permissions:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.molecules ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.mixtures ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.mixture_components ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.predictions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.experiments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.experiment_properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.calculation_methods ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.teams ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### RLS Policies

For each table, the following RLS policies were created:

#### 1. Public Read Access

Allows anyone to SELECT if is_public = true:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access on [table]" 
ON [table] 
FOR SELECT 
USING (is_public = true);
```

#### 2. Owner Full Access

Allows all operations if auth.uid() = created_by:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Owner full access on [table]" 
ON [table] 
USING (created_by = auth.uid());
```

#### 3. Team Member Access

Allows SELECT if the user is a member of the team associated with the record:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Team member access on [table]" 
ON [table] 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM projects
    JOIN teams ON teams.id = projects.team_id
    JOIN user_profile ON user_profile.team_id = teams.id
    WHERE projects.id = [table].project_id
    AND user_profile.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

#### 4. Service Role Bypass

Allows all operations if auth.role() = 'service_role':

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role bypass on [table]" 
ON [table] 
USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

## App-Specific Database Roles

The security implementation created the following database roles with specific permissions:

### 1. app_readonly

Can only SELECT from tables:

```sql
CREATE ROLE app_readonly;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_readonly;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_readonly;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO app_readonly;
```

### 2. app_user

Can SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE but not DELETE:

```sql
CREATE ROLE app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLES TO app_user;
```

### 3. app_admin

Has full access to all tables:

```sql
CREATE ROLE app_admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_admin;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO app_admin;
```

## Implementation Process

The security implementation process followed these steps:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Backup existing security settings
   - Create tracking tables to record all operations

2. **Execution**:
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Create RLS policies for each table
   - Create app-specific database roles
   - Grant appropriate permissions to each role

3. **Verification**:
   - Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
   - Verify all required policies are created
   - Verify app-specific roles are created with correct permissions

4. **Testing**:
   - Test service role access to all tables
   - Test public access for records with is_public = true
   - Test owner access for records created by the user
   - Test team member access for users who are members of the team

## Security Best Practices

The security implementation follows these security best practices:

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

The app-specific roles follow the principle of least privilege, giving users only the permissions they need:

- Read-only users can only read data
- Regular users can read, create, and update but not delete
- Admins have full access

### 2. Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security are implemented:

- Row Level Security at the database level
- Role-based access control
- Policy-based access control

### 3. Separation of Duties

Different roles have different permissions:

- app_readonly: Read-only access
- app_user: Read, create, update access
- app_admin: Full access

### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults

By default, access is denied unless explicitly granted:

- RLS denies access by default
- Policies explicitly grant access based on conditions

## Verification and Rollback

### Verification

The security implementation includes verification steps to ensure:

1. RLS is enabled on all tables
2. All required policies are created
3. App-specific roles are created with correct permissions

Verification results are saved to `security_verification_results.json`.

### Rollback

If needed, the security implementation can be rolled back:

1. Drop all policies created by the script
2. Disable RLS on tables that had it disabled before
3. Recreate original policies
4. Drop app-specific roles

## Impact on Application Code

The security implementation required updates to the application code:

1. **Authentication**: Updated to use the appropriate roles
2. **API Endpoints**: Modified to respect RLS policies
3. **Frontend**: Updated to show only accessible data

## Conclusion

The security implementation has significantly improved the CryoProtect security posture by:

1. Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized users
2. Implementing proper role-based access control
3. Following security best practices
4. Providing a solid foundation for secure application development

These changes have addressed the identified security vulnerabilities and created a more secure and robust application.
