## 3. Prompting Strategy Gaps

### 3.1 Evolutionary Development Approach

**Current State**: Prompting tends to focus on immediate tasks with limited evolutionary planning.

**Gap Analysis**:
- Tasks are often presented as discrete activities rather than evolutionary steps
- Limited context provided on how current tasks build toward long-term goals
- Insufficient background on how different components interact

**Recommendations**:
- Frame tasks within evolutionary development context
- Provide clear linkages between current tasks and long-term objectives
- Include system interaction diagrams in prompts
- Maintain continuity between related prompts

### 3.2 Knowledge Accumulation

**Current State**: Each prompt tends to be self-contained, with limited reference to accumulated knowledge.

**Gap Analysis**:
- Redundant context provided across prompts
- Limited leveraging of insights from previous tasks
- No systematic approach to building on previous work

**Recommendations**:
- Create a knowledge base of key insights and decisions
- Reference previous learnings in new prompts
- Develop a prompt taxonomy for easier reference
- Maintain decision logs that can be referenced in future prompts

### 3.3 Outcome-Based Specifications

**Current State**: Prompts often focus on activities rather than outcomes.

**Gap Analysis**:
- Tasks specified in terms of actions rather than desired outcomes
- Limited clarity on success criteria
- Insufficient guidance on verification approaches

**Recommendations**:
- Define prompts in terms of desired outcomes
- Include specific, measurable success criteria
- Provide guidance on verification methods
- Allow flexibility in implementation approaches

## 4. Documentation Gaps

### 4.1 Technical Documentation

**Current State**: Documentation exists but is fragmented and often task-specific.
