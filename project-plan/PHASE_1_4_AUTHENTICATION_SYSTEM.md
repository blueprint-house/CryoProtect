# Phase 1.4: Authentication System

## Objective
Replace the current service role workaround with a proper, secure authentication system that supports role-based access control.

## Tasks

### 1. Service Role Replacement
- Analyze current service role implementation and its limitations
- Design secure authentication flow without service role dependencies
- Implement proper JWT token handling and validation
- Create migration path from service role to new authentication system
- Document security improvements in the new implementation

### 2. User Session Management
- Implement secure session handling
- Add session timeout and refresh mechanisms
- Create session revocation capabilities
- Implement appropriate session storage
- Add audit logging for session activities

### 3. Token Management
- Implement JWT token generation with proper signing
- Add token refresh mechanisms
- Create token validation middleware
- Implement token revocation for security incidents
- Document token lifecycle management

### 4. Role-Based Access Control
- Define comprehensive role hierarchy
- Implement role assignment and management
- Create permission-based access controls
- Add role verification middleware
- Document role definitions and access control model

## Acceptance Criteria
- Authentication works without service role workarounds
- User sessions are properly managed and secured
- Tokens are securely generated, validated, and refreshed
- Role-based access controls restrict unauthorized access
- Authentication system is fully documented
- Security enhancements are verifiable through tests

## Dependencies
- Phase 1.3 (Database Architecture) should be completed first

## Estimated Effort
- 7-10 days
