# Phase 2.2: Core Functionality

## Objective
Complete the core functionality of the application, including predictive models, protocol designer, export capabilities, and system integrations.

## Tasks

### 1. Predictive Models Implementation
- Complete the machine learning infrastructure
- Implement model training and validation pipeline
- Create model versioning and storage system
- Add model evaluation metrics
- Implement API endpoints for model prediction

### 2. Protocol Designer
- Complete the protocol designer UI components
- Implement protocol validation logic
- Add saving and version tracking for protocols
- Create protocol execution simulation
- Implement protocol sharing functionality

### 3. Export/Sharing Capabilities
- Enhance data export to multiple formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Implement secure sharing mechanism
- Add access control for shared resources
- Create expiring links functionality
- Implement tracking for shared resources

### 4. External System Integration
- Design flexible integration framework
- Implement standard integration interfaces
- Create authentication mechanisms for external systems
- Add logging and monitoring for integrations
- Develop integration documentation and examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- Predictive models produce accurate results and are properly versioned
- Protocol designer allows creation, validation, and execution of protocols
- Export and sharing functions work securely and reliably
- External system integration framework is flexible and well-documented
- All functionality has appropriate unit and integration tests
- Performance meets established benchmarks

## Dependencies
- Phase 2.1 (API Layer Completion) should be completed first

## Estimated Effort
- 10-14 days
