# Phase 1.3: Database Architecture

## Objective
Optimize and complete the database architecture to ensure data integrity, security, and performance at scale.

## Tasks

### 1. Optimize RLS Implementation
- Review current RLS policies and identify performance bottlenecks
- Refine RLS implementation for complex queries
- Benchmark performance before and after optimizations
- Document RLS policy design and implementation
- Create RLS testing framework to verify policies

### 2. Connection Pooling
- Stress test current connection pooling implementation
- Identify and fix connection leaks
- Implement connection health monitoring
- Optimize pool size parameters for different environments
- Create documentation for connection pool tuning

### 3. Migration Framework
- Evaluate current migration approach
- Implement a robust version-based migration framework
- Create migration verification tools
- Document migration process and rollback procedures
- Test migration path from current to future schema changes

### 4. Data Integrity Verification
- Audit data integrity across all tables
- Verify foreign key relationships and constraints
- Implement database triggers for critical integrity checks
- Create automated data validation scripts
- Document data integrity requirements and verification process

## Acceptance Criteria
- RLS implementation provides proper security without significant performance impact
- Connection pooling handles peak loads without errors
- Migration framework successfully manages schema changes
- Data integrity is verified and maintained across operations
- All database changes are properly documented
- Performance benchmarks show improvement over baseline

## Dependencies
- Phase 1.1 (Code Cleanup) should be completed first

## Estimated Effort
- 8-12 days
