# CryoProtect v2 Implementation Plan for Roo Code

## Overview
This directory contains the implementation plan for completing the CryoProtect v2 project. Each phase is documented in detail with specific files, tasks, and implementation approaches to guide Roo Code's autonomous project management.

## How to Use This Plan with Roo Code

### Prompt Pattern
Use the following prompt pattern when working with Roo Code:

```
I want to implement the following plan: @project-plan/PHASE_X_X_FILENAME.md. Please analyze the current codebase state and break this down into actionable subtasks that can be implemented efficiently.
```

### Implementation Approach
- Each phase document should be broken down into smaller subtasks
- Focus on completing one task before moving to the next
- Regularly track progress against the plan
- Update the plan as needed based on implementation realities

## Current Status

### Completed Phases
- **Phase 1.1: Code Cleanup** ✅
- **Phase 1.2: Testing Infrastructure** ✅ 
- **Phase 1.3: Database Architecture** ✅
- **Phase 1.4: Authentication System** ✅

### In Progress
- **Phase 2.1: API Documentation** ⏳
  - API documentation structure created
  - OpenAPI/Swagger implementation needed

### Next Phases (Priority Order)
1. **Phase 2.1: API Documentation** - Complete OpenAPI implementation
2. **Phase 2.2: Protocol Designer** - Enhance protocol management
3. **Phase 2.2: Export/Sharing** - Implement data sharing capabilities
4. **Phase 2.3: User Interface** - Improve UX, responsiveness, and visualization
5. **Phase 3.1: Deployment Infrastructure** - Enhance deployment pipeline

## Implementation Files

Each phase has a detailed markdown file:

| Phase | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 2.1 | `PHASE_2_1_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` | API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger |
| 2.2 | `PHASE_2_2_PROTOCOL_DESIGNER.md` | Protocol designer enhancement |
| 2.2 | `PHASE_2_2_EXPORT_SHARING.md` | Export and sharing capabilities |
| 2.3 | `PHASE_2_3_USER_INTERFACE_ENHANCED.md` | User interface improvements |
| 3.1 | `PHASE_3_1_DEPLOYMENT_INFRASTRUCTURE_ENHANCED.md` | Deployment infrastructure |

## Environment Setup

If you encounter SciPy import errors or other environment issues, refer to:
- `ENVIRONMENT_FIX.md` - Solutions for environment setup problems

## Key Files Reference

The implementation files reference specific files that need to be modified. These files already exist in the project unless explicitly stated as "to be created".

## Optimization for Roo Code

### Cost Efficiency
- Break down tasks into small, manageable chunks
- Focus on high-impact changes first
- Reuse existing code and patterns where possible
- Implement one feature at a time completely before moving to the next

### Progress Tracking
- Use GitHub issues to track implementation progress
- Create a milestone for each phase
- Tag issues with the appropriate phase
- Regular progress check-ins

## Update Process

This plan is a living document. As implementation progresses, update the status sections of this README to reflect the current state of the project.
