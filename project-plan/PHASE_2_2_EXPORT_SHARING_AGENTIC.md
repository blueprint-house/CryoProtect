## Implementation Instructions for Roo Code PM

1. **Task Grouping**: Group tasks by implementation area (export vs. sharing)
2. **Security Priority**: Emphasize security for all sharing functionality
3. **Testing Focus**: Establish thorough testing for all data handling
4. **Parallel Development**: 
   - Export tasks (1A-1D) can be developed in parallel
   - Sharing tasks (2A-2C) should be sequential
5. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed docs for security-critical components

## Testing Protocol

After each micro-task:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests
2. Test with realistic and edge-case data
3. Verify security implications of all sharing functionality
4. Performance test with large datasets
5. Validate all API endpoints

## Specialized Agent Selection

- Export Tasks (1A-1D): Data Processing Specialist Agent
- Sharing Database Tasks (2A): Database Specialist Agent
- Security Tasks (2B-2C): Security Specialist Agent
- Access Control Tasks (3A-3B): Authorization Specialist Agent
- API Tasks (4A-4B): API Specialist Agent

## Next Phase Planning

After these tasks are complete, focus on:
1. Frontend UI for export and sharing
2. Notification system for shared items
3. Analytics dashboard for shared content
4. External system integration for exports
