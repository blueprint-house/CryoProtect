# Phase 3.1: Deployment Infrastructure Enhancement

## Objective
Create a robust deployment infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipeline, optimized Docker configuration, standardized environment management, and zero-downtime deployment strategies.

## Key Files
- `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `/Dockerfile` - Docker container definition
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Multi-container setup
- `/.env.template` - Environment variable template
- `/scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment script (to be created)

## Background
The current deployment setup has basic GitHub Actions and Docker configuration but needs enhancement to support a full CI/CD pipeline, optimized containers, environment management, and advanced deployment strategies.

## Tasks

### 1. Enhance CI/CD Pipeline
- Expand GitHub Actions workflow with testing stages
- Add code quality checks (linting, static analysis)
- Implement build artifact management
- Create deployment verification steps

**Files to modify:**
- `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Update existing workflow)
- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` (Create for continuous integration)
- `/.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` (Create for PR checks)
- `/scripts/ci-checks.sh` (Create for CI scripts)

### 2. Optimize Docker Configuration
- Implement multi-stage Docker builds
- Optimize image size and build process
- Add security hardening to Docker configuration
- Create production-optimized Docker Compose setup

**Files to modify:**
- `/Dockerfile` (Update with multi-stage build)
- `/docker-compose.yml` (Optimize for production)
- `/docker-compose.dev.yml` (Create for development)
- `/docker-compose.prod.yml` (Create for production)

### 3. Standardize Environment Configuration
- Create comprehensive environment variable management
- Implement environment-specific configuration loading
- Add configuration validation
- Create secrets management system

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/.env.template` (Update with all variables)
- `/config/config.py` (Create for configuration management)
- `/config/environments/` (Create directory with env configs)
- `/scripts/validate-config.py` (Create validation script)

### 4. Implement Blue/Green Deployment
- Create blue/green deployment capability
- Implement zero-downtime deployment process
- Add automated rollback mechanisms
- Create health check monitoring for deployments

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/scripts/deploy.sh` (Create deployment script)
- `/scripts/rollback.sh` (Create rollback script)
- `/scripts/health-check.sh` (Create health check script)
- `/docs/operations/deployment.md` (Create deployment docs)

### 5. Add Infrastructure as Code
- Create Terraform configuration for infrastructure
- Add AWS/Azure/GCP deployment templates
- Implement infrastructure validation checks
- Create infrastructure documentation

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/terraform/` (Create directory)
- `/terraform/main.tf` (Create main configuration)
- `/terraform/modules/` (Create modules directory)
- `/docs/operations/infrastructure.md` (Create docs)

### 6. Implement Container Orchestration
- Add Kubernetes configuration for production
- Create Helm charts for deployment
- Implement auto-scaling configuration
- Add persistent volume management

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/kubernetes/` (Create directory)
- `/kubernetes/deployment.yaml` (Create deployment config)
- `/kubernetes/service.yaml` (Create service config)
- `/helm/` (Create Helm chart directory)

### 7. Create Deployment Monitoring
- Implement deployment health checks
- Add deployment metrics collection
- Create deployment notification system
- Implement post-deployment verification

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/scripts/deployment-monitor.py` (Create monitoring script)
- `/scripts/notify-deployment.py` (Create notification script)
- `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Add monitoring steps)
- `/docs/operations/monitoring.md` (Create monitoring docs)

### 8. Implement Database Migration CI/CD
- Add automated database migration to deployment
- Create database backup before migrations
- Implement migration verification
- Add rollback capabilities for failed migrations

**Files to create/modify:**
- `/scripts/db-migrate.sh` (Create migration script)
- `/scripts/db-backup.sh` (Create backup script)
- `/scripts/db-verify.sh` (Create verification script)
- `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Add database steps)

## Implementation Approach
- **Break into subtasks**: Divide each task into smaller implementation steps
- **Progressive implementation**: Start with CI/CD, then Docker, then environment management
- **Test thoroughly**: Test each deployment enhancement in staging before production
- **Document everything**: Create comprehensive documentation for operations
- **Automated verification**: Add automated checks for each deployment step

## Expected Outcome
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline with testing and verification
- Optimized Docker configuration for development and production
- Standardized environment management across all environments
- Zero-downtime deployment with automated rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive infrastructure as code for all components

## Note to Roo Code
This plan should be implemented incrementally, breaking each task into smaller subtasks. Start with the CI/CD pipeline enhancements as they form the foundation for other improvements. The Docker optimization should focus on both performance and security. Environment configuration standardization is critical for consistency across environments. The blue/green deployment implementation should be thoroughly tested in staging before being used in production. All deployment changes should be well-documented for operations staff.
