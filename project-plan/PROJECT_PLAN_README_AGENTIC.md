# CryoProtect v2 Implementation Plan for Roo Code Agents

## Overview
This document provides the master implementation plan for completing the CryoProtect v2 project using Roo Code's autonomous agents. Each phase of development has been broken down into micro-tasks specifically designed for specialized agents to implement efficiently.

## Current Project Status

### Completed Phases ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1.1: Code Cleanup** - Backup files removed, team models consolidated, reports organized
- **Phase 1.2: Testing Infrastructure** - Test fixtures created, coverage reporting implemented
- **Phase 1.3: Database Architecture** - Connection pooling, RLS optimization, migration framework
- **Phase 1.4: Authentication System** - JWT authentication, session management, token handling

### In Progress ‚è≥
- **Phase 2.1: API Documentation** - Infrastructure complete, Schema documentation in progress
  - Core infrastructure and Swagger UI implemented
  - RDKit schemas completed
  - Core resource schemas and endpoint documentation in progress

### Pending Phases üîÑ
- **Phase 2.2: Protocol Designer** - Implementation not started
- **Phase 2.2: Export/Sharing** - Implementation not started
- **Phase 2.3: User Interface** - Implementation not started
- **Phase 3.1-3.3: Production Readiness** - Implementation not started
- **Phase 4.1-4.2: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer** - Implementation not started

## Agentic Implementation Approach

### Micro-Task Structure
Each implementation phase is broken down into micro-tasks designed for specialized agents:

1. **Self-contained**: Each micro-task has clear inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria
2. **Agent-specific**: Tasks are tailored for specific agent types (Schema, API, Scientific, etc.)
3. **Sequenced**: Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies
4. **Verifiable**: Each task has specific acceptance criteria for validation

### Task Assignment Process
The Roo PM should use this process to assign tasks:

1. Identify the current phase from this document
2. Select the next micro-task from the phase-specific plan document
3. Assign to the appropriate specialized agent
4. Verify completion against acceptance criteria
5. Update progress status
6. Select the next micro-task

## Implementation Plans by Phase

### Current Priority: Phase 2.1
**File**: `PHASE_2_1_API_DOCUMENTATION_AGENTIC.md`
**Focus**: API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
**Current Task**: Schema documentation for core resources
**Next Tasks**: 
- Document core API endpoints
- Document scientific API endpoints
- Create API usage examples

### Next Priority: Phase 2.2 (Protocol Designer)
**File**: `PHASE_2_2_PROTOCOL_DESIGNER_AGENTIC.md`
**Focus**: Protocol designer functionality
**First Tasks**:
- Protocol data model
- Protocol validation
- Protocol simulation

### Parallel Priority: Phase 2.2 (Export/Sharing)
**File**: `PHASE_2_2_EXPORT_SHARING_AGENTIC.md`
**Focus**: Data export and secure sharing
**First Tasks**:
- Export format implementations
- Sharing database structure
- Token-based sharing system

## Specialized Agent Types

The project leverages these specialized agent types:

- **Schema Specialist**: Data models and validation
- **API Specialist**: Endpoint implementation and documentation
- **Scientific Specialist**: Domain-specific scientific functionality
- **Security Specialist**: Authentication and data protection
- **Frontend Specialist**: UI components and interactions
- **Database Specialist**: Database operations and optimization
- **DevOps Specialist**: Deployment and infrastructure

## Roo PM Guidelines

For detailed PM instructions, refer to `ROO_PM_GUIDE.md`, which covers:

- Task assignment process
- Multi-agent coordination
- Progress tracking
- Dependency management
- Testing protocols

## How to Use This Plan

### For Initial Assessment
```
I want to implement the following plan: @project-plan/PROJECT_PLAN_README_AGENTIC.md. Please analyze our current project status and recommend which phase and task we should focus on next.
```

### For Phase-Specific Work
```
I want to implement the following plan: @project-plan/PHASE_2_1_API_DOCUMENTATION_AGENTIC.md. Please identify the next incomplete micro-task and prepare to assign it to the appropriate specialized agent.
```

### For Specialized Agent Assignment
```
As a [SPECIALIST_TYPE] Agent, implement the [MICRO_TASK_NAME] from @project-plan/[PHASE_PLAN_FILE].md. Focus specifically on [SPECIFIC_FOCUS_AREA].
```

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
