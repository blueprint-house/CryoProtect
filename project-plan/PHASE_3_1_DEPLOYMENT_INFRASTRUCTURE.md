# Phase 3.1: Deployment Infrastructure

## Objective
Establish a robust deployment infrastructure with CI/CD pipeline, optimized Docker configuration, and standardized environment management.

## Tasks

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline
- Enhance the existing GitHub Actions workflow
- Add automated testing to CI pipeline
- Implement code quality checks (linting, static analysis)
- Create build artifacts for different environments
- Add deployment verification steps

### 2. Docker Configuration
- Optimize Docker image size and build process
- Implement multi-stage builds
- Add security hardening to Docker configuration
- Create production-optimized Docker Compose setup
- Implement container health checks

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Standardize environment variable management
- Create environment-specific configuration files
- Implement secrets management
- Add configuration validation
- Document environment setup procedures

### 4. Deployment Strategy
- Implement blue/green deployment capability
- Create rollback mechanisms
- Add zero-downtime deployment process
- Implement canary deployments for risk reduction
- Document deployment workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI/CD pipeline automatically tests and deploys code changes
- Docker configuration is optimized for production use
- Environment configuration is standardized and secure
- Deployment processes minimize downtime and risk
- All deployment procedures are documented
- Team members can deploy with confidence

## Dependencies
- Phase 2.3 (User Interface) should be completed first

## Estimated Effort
- 5-8 days
