# PM Agent Instructions for CryoProtect v2 Completion

## Overview

This document provides instructions for PM agents to effectively manage the CryoProtect v2 project completion using a "boomerang" subtask approach. The project is organized into four major phases with specific subtasks, each documented in its own Markdown file.

## Using the Phase Documentation

Each phase and subtask has a dedicated Markdown file with a consistent structure:
- **Objective**: The goal to achieve
- **Tasks**: Specific actions to complete
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to determine if the work is complete
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Estimated Effort**: Time estimation

## Boomerang Subtask Management Process

### 1. Task Assignment
- Assign tasks based on the phase files in the project-plan directory
- Break down phase tasks into smaller boomerang subtasks
- Include clear acceptance criteria for each subtask
- Prioritize subtasks based on dependencies and critical path

### 2. Task Tracking
- Maintain a task board showing:
  - Backlog
  - Ready
  - In Progress
  - Under Review
  - Completed
- Update task status daily
- Track completion percentage against project timeline

### 3. Boomerang Process
- **Send Out**: Assign a subtask with clear requirements
- **Check Back**: Schedule a check-in for the estimated completion date
- **Verify Completion**: Review against acceptance criteria
- **Feedback Loop**: Provide feedback and adjust future assignments accordingly

### 4. Dependency Management
- Consult the PROJECT_PLAN_OVERVIEW.md for dependencies between phases
- Schedule tasks to respect these dependencies
- Identify blockers early and escalate when necessary

## Communication Guidelines

- Daily standup format:
  - What was completed yesterday?
  - What is planned for today?
  - Are there any blockers?
- Weekly project review:
  - Progress against timeline
  - Risk assessment update
  - Upcoming milestone planning

## Risk Management

- Proactively monitor the risks identified in PROJECT_PLAN_OVERVIEW.md
- Implement the suggested mitigation strategies
- Review risks weekly and adjust priorities as needed

## Project Tracking Metrics

- **Sprint Velocity**: Tasks completed per sprint
- **Burndown Chart**: Remaining work over time
- **Phase Completion**: Percentage of phase tasks completed
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code with test coverage
- **Bug Count**: Number of open/fixed bugs

## Completion Definition

A phase is considered complete when:
1. All tasks listed in the phase document are finished
2. All acceptance criteria are met
3. The work has been reviewed and approved
4. Documentation is updated to reflect the changes
5. No regressions are introduced

## Tools and Resources

- Use GitHub Issues for task tracking
- Link each issue to the corresponding task in the phase documents
- Use milestones to group tasks by phase
- Utilize labels for priority, type, and status

## Project Completion Target

The overall project has an estimated completion time of 16 weeks, with individual phase timelines outlined in PROJECT_PLAN_OVERVIEW.md.
