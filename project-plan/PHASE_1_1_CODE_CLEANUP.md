# Phase 1.1: Code Cleanup

## Objective
Clean up the codebase by removing unnecessary files, consolidating scattered components, and organizing documentation to improve maintainability.

## Tasks

### 1. Remove Backup Files and Update .gitignore
- Identify and remove all backup files throughout the codebase
- Update .gitignore to prevent future backup files from being committed
- Focus on files with patterns like *_backup.*, *.bak, duplicate script variations
- Verify removal doesn't impact functionality

### 2. Consolidate Team Models
- Review current team model implementations across files
- Consolidate all team-related models into a single location in api/team_models.py
- Update imports in all files referencing team models
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Add comprehensive documentation

### 3. Organize Reports
- Create a structured directory hierarchy for reports
- Categorize reports by type (performance, security, API, database)
- Move all reports to their appropriate locations
- Update any references to report locations

### 4. Standardize Documentation Structure
- Create a documentation template for README files
- Update all existing documentation to follow the template
- Organize documentation by functional area
- Ensure all critical components have proper documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- All backup files have been removed
- Team models are consolidated in a single location
- Reports are organized in a logical structure
- Documentation follows a standardized format
- No functionality is broken by these changes
- All changes are committed to version control

## Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational task)

## Estimated Effort
- 3-4 days
