# CryoProtect v2 - Updated Implementation Plan

This directory contains the updated implementation plan for completing the CryoProtect v2 project using Roo Code in VS Code with Boomerang mode.

## Project Status

The [Progress Report](PROGRESS_REPORT.md) provides a comprehensive assessment of the current project status, including:

- âœ… **Completed Tasks**: Backup files removal, team models consolidation, reports organization
- ðŸŸ¨ **In Progress Tasks**: Maintenance utility, test organization, database remediation
- ðŸŸ¥ **Pending Tasks**: Predictive models, export functionality, monitoring

## Roo Code Implementation Plan

This plan is optimized for sequential implementation using Roo Code in Boomerang mode with a project manager agent.

### Project Manager Agent

The [ROO_AGENT_CONFIG.json](ROO_AGENT_CONFIG.json) file contains the configuration for the project management agent, including:

- Project phases and tasks
- Task template structure
- Progress tracking information
- Implementation instructions

### Implementation Tasks

Based on our analysis, we've created detailed task definitions for sequential implementation:

#### Phase 1: Maintenance Utility Completion

1. [TASK_2_1_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md](TASK_2_1_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md) - Implement Foreign Key Relationships Fix Module
2. [TASK_2_2_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md](TASK_2_2_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md) - Implement Authentication Fix Module
3. [TASK_2_3_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md](TASK_2_3_MAINTENANCE_UTIL.md) - Implement RLS Implementation Fix Module

#### Phase 2: Testing Framework Enhancement

1. [TASK_3_1_TEST_FIX.md](TASK_3_1_TEST_FIX.md) - Fix ImportError Issues in Test Modules

### Implementation Approach

Each task definition includes:

1. **Clear Objective**: What needs to be accomplished
2. **Detailed Context**: Why the task matters
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable outcomes
4. **Implementation Steps**: Specific code changes and commands
5. **Files to Modify**: Exact file paths
6. **Verification Steps**: How to confirm successful implementation

## Using This Plan with Roo Code

1. Import the `ROO_AGENT_CONFIG.json` file into Roo Code to set up the project manager agent
2. Begin with the first task (Implement Foreign Key Relationships Fix Module)
3. Let the agent guide you through sequential implementation
4. Verify completion of each task before moving to the next
5. Update the progress tracking in the agent configuration as tasks are completed

## Next Steps After Current Tasks

After completing the current tasks, the project will continue with:

1. **API Completion**: Standardizing error handling and documentation
2. **Predictive Models Implementation**: Core algorithms and visualization
3. **Production Readiness**: Monitoring and deployment verification

The sequential approach ensures consistent progress toward project completion while maintaining clear context between implementation sessions.
