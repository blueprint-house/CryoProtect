## Latest Milestone Completed
Successfully implemented a unified test directory structure with consistent organization and patterns.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Database Operations Consolidation ‚úÖ
1. **Database Package Structure** ‚úÖ

   - Implemented package hierarchy with proper subdirectories
   - Created main entry point modules with well-defined interfaces
   - Added comprehensive docstrings and README files
   - Implemented connection utilities

2. **Database Population Module** ‚úÖ
   - Consolidated multiple population scripts into a modular system
   - Implemented a unified CLI entry point for all population operations
   - Created clean API for programmatic and CLI usage
   - Added support for different environments
   - Implemented robust error handling and logging
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing data formats

3. **Migration Management Module** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented a modular migration system with version tracking
   - Created functions for applying and rolling back migrations
   - Added support for tracking applied migrations
   - Created CLI interface for migration operations
   - Implemented detailed reporting and logging
   - Added thorough documentation and examples

4. **Verification Module** ‚úÖ
   - Created comprehensive database verification system
   - Implemented schema, constraint, and data quality verification
   - Added support for different verification levels 
   - Created detailed reporting in multiple formats
   - Integrated with Supabase adapter for reliable database operations

5. **Supabase Adapter Layer** ‚úÖ
   - Created adapter to normalize Supabase API responses
   - Implemented consistent error handling
   - Added robust logging and diagnostics
   - Created unit tests for adapter functionality
   - Integrated adapter with verification module

### Phase 2: Testing Framework Unification üîÑ
1. **Unified Test Directory Structure** ‚úÖ
   - Reorganized scattered test files into a logical hierarchy
   - Created consistent naming patterns for easy test discovery
   - Separated different types of tests (unit, integration, etc.)
   - Created clear documentation explaining test organization
   - Fixed critical issues with mocking and patching
   - Verified all migrated tests run successfully

## Current Work

1. **Shared Test Fixtures** üîÑ
   - Created detailed task definition with implementation plan
   - Designed comprehensive fixtures for database, API, and auth testing
   - Prepared code examples for mock objects and test utilities
   - Ready for implementation

## Current Progress

- **Phase 2: Testing Framework Unification**
  - Task 2.1: Create unified test directory structure ‚úÖ
  - Task 2.2: Implement shared test fixtures üîÑ (Next)
  - Task 2.3: Consolidate API testing ‚è≥
  - Task 2.4: Enhance test coverage reporting ‚è≥

## Next Steps

The next task is to implement shared test fixtures (Task 2.2), which will:
1. Create reusable fixtures for database, API, and auth testing
2. Implement mock objects for external dependencies
3. Provide data fixtures for common test scenarios
4. Add clear documentation for all fixtures
5. Integrate with pytest's fixture system

## Overall Progress

- Completed: 6/24 tasks (25%)
- Current phase: Testing Framework Unification (Phase 2 of 6)
- On target for completion by: July 15, 2025
