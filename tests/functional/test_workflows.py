"""
Functional tests for user workflows.

This module contains functional tests that verify end-to-end user workflows
in the CryoProtect v2 application. Functional tests simulate real user scenarios
and validate that the system behaves as expected across multiple components.

Test structure follows the conventions established in the unified test plan.
