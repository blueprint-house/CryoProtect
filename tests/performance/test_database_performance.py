"""
Performance tests for database operations.

This module contains performance tests for database queries and related operations.
Tests are structured according to the conventions in updated-plan/TASK_2_1_TEST_STRUCTURE.md.

Each test should:
- Be named with the prefix 'test_'.
- Measure and assert performance characteristics (e.g., execution time).
- Include clear docstrings describing the test's purpose.
