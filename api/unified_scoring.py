CryoProtect Analyzer API - Unified Scoring Module

This module provides a comprehensive scoring system that combines:
1. Cryoprotection efficacy (from scoring.py)
2. Toxicity data (from Tox21)
3. Glass transition temperature (Tg) predictions

The unified scoring system provides a balanced assessment of cryoprotectant candidates,
considering both effectiveness and safety profiles.

Scientific Context:
    The ideal cryoprotectant should balance several key properties:
    - High cryoprotective efficacy (ability to prevent ice formation and protect cells)
    - Low toxicity (minimal adverse effects on biological systems)
    - Appropriate glass transition temperature (Tg) for the specific application
    - Good permeability and biocompatibility

    Different applications may require different balancing of these properties:
    - Cell preservation may prioritize efficacy and permeability
    - Organ preservation may prioritize low toxicity and optimal Tg
    - Long-term storage may prioritize glass-forming ability and stability
