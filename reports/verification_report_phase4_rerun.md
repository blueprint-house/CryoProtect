# Phase 4 Database Population Verification Report (Rerun)

**Date:** 2025-05-01  
**Task:** task-dbfix-p4.3 (Full Verification Test, Rerun)  
**Runner:** Guardian Validator

---

## Summary

The comprehensive verification test of the database population workflow was executed using the updated scripts and session pooler connection. The process included schema verification, constraint verification, and JSON property checks as required by Section 5.3 of `DATABASE_POPULATION_ISSUES.md`.

**Result:** ‚ùå **FAILED**

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Schema Verification

- **FAILED**: Multiple critical errors detected.
- **Major issues:**
  - **Missing columns:**  
    - `properties` column missing from `molecules`, `mixtures`, and `mixture_components` tables.
    - Other required columns missing from `molecular_properties`, `calculation_methods`, `experiments`, and `predictions`.
  - **Type mismatches:**  
    - Several columns (e.g., `id`, `name`, `mixture_id`, `molecule_id`) have type `uuid` or `character varying` instead of expected `varchar`.
  - **Nullability mismatches:**  
    - Columns such as `created_at` and `updated_at` have unexpected nullability settings.

### 2. Constraint Verification

- **PASSED**: No constraint issues detected.

### 3. JSON Property Verification

- **FAILED**:  
  - Query failed: `column "properties" does not exist` in `molecules` table.
  - No JSON property data could be verified.

## Detailed Error Log

- **Schema errors:**  
  - See `reports/verification_report_phase4_rerun.json` for the full list of schema issues.
- **JSON property check:**  
  - `Error during JSON property verification: column "properties" does not exist`

---

## Performance & Monitoring

- The verification runner executed successfully using the session pooler connection.
- No connection or performance issues were observed during the test run.

---

## Conclusion

The database schema does **not** meet the required structure for the population workflow. Critical columns are missing, and type/nullability mismatches are present. Data quality verification at checkpoints failed due to missing columns. Remediation is required before the workflow can be considered validated.
