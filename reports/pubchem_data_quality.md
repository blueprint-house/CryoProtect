# PubChem Data Quality Report

Generated on: 2025-04-29 19:27:30

## Overall Assessment

**Status: WARNING** ⚠️

The PubChem data in the database has some quality or completeness issues that should be addressed.

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| PubChem Molecules | 693 |
| PubChem Properties | 0 |

## Data Completeness

### Basic Fields

| Field | Null Count | Null Percentage |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Name | 0 | 0.00% |
| SMILES | 0 | 0.00% |
| PubChem CID | 0 | 0.00% |

All PubChem molecules have their basic fields (name, SMILES, PubChem CID) populated, which is excellent.

### Property Completeness

| Property | Count | Coverage (%) |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| LogP | 0 | 0.0% |
| H-bond Donor Count | 0 | 0.0% |
| H-bond Acceptor Count | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Average Coverage** | - | **0.0%** |

**Critical Issue**: None of the PubChem molecules have any properties stored in the molecular_properties table. This is a significant data quality issue that needs to be addressed.

## Findings

1. **Molecule Data**: The database contains 693 PubChem molecules with complete basic information (name, SMILES, PubChem CID).
2. **Property Data**: None of the PubChem molecules have any properties in the molecular_properties table, including critical properties like LogP, H-bond donor count, and H-bond acceptor count.
3. **Database Schema**: The database uses a normalized schema where:
   - Molecules are stored in the `molecules` table with a `data_source` field indicating the source
   - Properties are stored in the `molecular_properties` table with a `property_type_id` referencing the `property_types` table
   - Property types for LogP, H-bond donor count, and H-bond acceptor count exist in the `property_types` table

## Recommendations

The PubChem data quality has critical issues that must be addressed. Recommended next steps:

1. **Property Import**: Implement a process to import and store properties for PubChem molecules in the molecular_properties table. Focus on the following properties first:
   - LogP (property_type_id: 6ff67057-fc79-4b96-a604-de5d08b49f51)
   - H-bond Donor Count (property_type_id: 4c2b6f49-a766-4420-b677-3d73a4ca0616)
   - H-bond Acceptor Count (property_type_id: 92557dcc-3268-4351-9f0b-d13da120bd85)

2. **Data Enrichment**: Consider using the RDKit library to calculate missing properties for molecules that have SMILES strings but lack property data.

3. **Validation Process**: Implement a validation process that runs after PubChem imports to ensure that all required properties are present.

4. **Documentation**: Update the PubChem import documentation to clarify which properties should be imported and how they should be stored in the database.

5. **Re-run Validation**: After implementing the above recommendations, re-run this validation to verify that the property completeness has improved.
