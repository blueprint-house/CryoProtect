  Query                  | Before                | After
  -----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------

Recommendations:
  1. Monitor query performance in production
  2. Consider adding additional indexes if specific queries are still slow
  3. Regularly analyze tables to update statistics
  4. Utilize the memory bank caching for frequently accessed data
  5. Periodically verify index health and rebuild if necessary
  6. Consider implementing connection pooling tuning based on workload
  7. Apply future performance improvements in batches with verification
