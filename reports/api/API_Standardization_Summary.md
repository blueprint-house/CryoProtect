# API Standardization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to standardize the API endpoints in the CryoProtect v2 codebase.

## Overview of Changes

The following changes were made to standardize the API endpoints:

1. **Implemented Missing Endpoints**:
   - Added batch operation status and cancellation endpoints in `batch_resources.py`
   - Added molecular dynamics endpoint in `rdkit_enhanced_resources.py`
   - Added batch scoring endpoint in `scoring_resources.py`
   - Added batch training and model evaluation endpoints in `predictive_models_resources.py`
   - Created a new file `system_resources.py` for system status, logs, and metrics endpoints

2. **Fixed Incomplete Endpoints**:
   - Implemented MFA functionality in `app.py`
   - Fixed URL patterns in `mixture_analysis_resources.py` (changed '/api/mixtures/...' to '/api/v1/mixtures/...')
   - Fixed URL patterns in `protocol_designer_resources.py` (changed '/protocols/...' and '/mixtures/...' to '/api/v1/protocols/...' and '/api/v1/mixtures/...')
   - Fixed URL patterns in `predictive_models_resources.py` (changed '/predictive-models/...' to '/api/v1/predictive-models/...')
   - Fixed URL patterns in `dashboard_resources.py` (changed '/dashboard/...' to '/api/v1/dashboard/...')
   - Fixed URL patterns in `rdkit_enhanced_resources.py` (changed '/rdkit/...' to '/api/v1/rdkit-enhanced/...')
   - Added missing `@token_required` decorator for authentication in `mixture_analysis_resources.py` and `protocol_designer_resources.py`
   - Fixed inconsistent error handling in `dashboard_resources.py`, `mixture_analysis_resources.py`, and `protocol_designer_resources.py`

## Detailed Changes

### 1. New System Resources

Created a new file `system_resources.py` with the following endpoints:
- `/api/v1/system/status` - Get detailed system status information
- `/api/v1/system/logs` - Get system logs with filtering options
- `/api/v1/system/metrics` - Get system metrics for monitoring

### 2. Batch Operations

Added the following endpoints to `batch_resources.py`:
- `/api/v1/batch/<operation_id>` - Get the status of a batch operation
- `/api/v1/batch/<operation_id>` - Cancel a batch operation (DELETE method)

### 3. RDKit Enhanced Resources

Added the following endpoint to `rdkit_enhanced_resources.py`:
- `/api/v1/rdkit-enhanced/molecular-dynamics` - Run molecular dynamics simulations

### 4. Scoring Resources

Added the following endpoint to `scoring_resources.py`:
- `/api/v1/scoring/batch` - Calculate scores for multiple molecules or mixtures in batch

### 5. Predictive Models Resources

Added the following endpoints to `predictive_models_resources.py`:
- `/api/v1/predictive-models/train-batch` - Train multiple predictive models in batch
- `/api/v1/predictive-models/evaluate` - Evaluate a predictive model using test data or cross-validation

### 6. MFA Implementation

Implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in `app.py`:
- Enhanced `/auth/mfa/initiate` endpoint to generate and store MFA codes
- Enhanced `/auth/mfa/verify` endpoint to verify MFA codes and create user sessions

### 7. URL Pattern Standardization

Standardized URL patterns across all API resources to follow the `/api/v1/...` pattern:
- Updated `mixture_analysis_resources.py`
- Updated `protocol_designer_resources.py`
- Updated `predictive_models_resources.py`
- Updated `dashboard_resources.py`
- Updated `rdkit_enhanced_resources.py`

### 8. Authentication Standardization

Added `@token_required` decorator to endpoints that were missing authentication:
- Added to `MixturePropertiesResource`, `MixtureCompatibilityResource`, `MixtureSynergyResource`, and `MixtureAnalysisResource` in `mixture_analysis_resources.py`
- Added to `ProtocolResource`, `MixtureProtocolsResource`, and `SampleSensitivityProfilesResource` in `protocol_designer_resources.py`

### 9. Error Handling Standardization

Standardized error handling across all API resources to use the `handle_error` utility function consistently.

## Remaining Issues

All identified issues in the API_Endpoints_Status_Report.md have been addressed. The API now has a consistent structure, authentication, and error handling across all endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. Update API documentation to reflect the new and updated endpoints
2. Implement comprehensive tests for all endpoints
3. Consider adding rate limiting to protect against abuse
4. Consider adding API versioning strategy for future updates
