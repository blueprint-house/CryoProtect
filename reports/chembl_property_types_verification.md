# ChEMBL Property Types Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-04-26  
**Task:** task-imp-chembl-property-types-001  
**Author:** Apex Implementer  

## 1. Overview

This report documents the verification and remediation of the `property_types` table to ensure all canonical property types exist as specified in `.specs/chembl_property_types_remediation.md`.

## 2. Initial State

The initial query of the `property_types` table revealed the following property types were already present:

- Cell Permeability
- Cell Viability
- Glass Transition Temperature
- Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (needed renaming)
- Hydrogen Bond Donors (needed renaming)
- Ice Crystal Growth Inhibition
- Ice Nucleation Inhibition
- LogP
- Molecular Weight
- Organ Function Recovery
- Rotatable Bonds (needed renaming)
- Toxicity
- TPSA
- Viscosity Effect
- Vitrification Concentration

## 3. Remediation Actions

The following actions were taken to ensure compliance with the canonical property types specification:

### 3.1 Name Updates

The following property types were renamed to match the canonical names:

| Original Name | Updated Name |
|---------------|--------------|
| Hydrogen Bond Donors | Hydrogen Bond Donor Count |
| Hydrogen Bond Acceptors | Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Count |
| Rotatable Bonds | Rotatable Bond Count |

### 3.2 Added Property Types

The following property types were added to the database:

| Name | Description | Units | Data Type |
|------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| LogD | Distribution coefficient | NULL | numeric |
| Stability | Chemical stability information | NULL | text |
| Environmental Safety | Environmental impact information | NULL | text |
| Hydrogen Bonding Score | Score for hydrogen bonding capability | NULL | numeric |
| Solubility Score | Score for solubility and polarity | NULL | numeric |
| Membrane Permeability Score | Score for membrane permeability | NULL | numeric |
| Toxicity Score | Score for toxicity and biocompatibility | NULL | numeric |
| Stability Score | Score for stability and reactivity | NULL | numeric |
| Environmental Score | Score for environmental safety | NULL | numeric |
| Total Score | Overall cryoprotectant score | NULL | numeric |
| Unknown Property Type | Fallback for unknown property types | NULL | text |

## 4. Verification

After remediation, all canonical property types are now present in the database:

1. ✅ Molecular Weight
2. ✅ LogP
3. ✅ LogD
4. ✅ TPSA
5. ✅ Hydrogen Bond Donor Count
6. ✅ Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Count
7. ✅ Rotatable Bond Count
8. ✅ Toxicity
9. ✅ Stability
10. ✅ Environmental Safety
11. ✅ Hydrogen Bonding Score
12. ✅ Solubility Score
13. ✅ Membrane Permeability Score
14. ✅ Toxicity Score
15. ✅ Stability Score
16. ✅ Environmental Score
17. ✅ Total Score

Additionally, the "Unknown Property Type" was added as a fallback for unknown property types, as specified in the fallback logic section of the specification.

## 5. Implementation Details

The remediation was implemented using a SQL migration script that:

1. Updated existing property types to match the canonical names
2. Added missing property types with the correct schema
3. Used ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING to ensure idempotence

The migration was applied using the Supabase MCP tools and verified with a follow-up query to ensure all canonical property types are present.

## 6. Conclusion

The `property_types` table has been successfully remediated to include all canonical property types as specified in the requirements. The table now contains all required property types with the correct names, descriptions, units, and data types.

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- All canonical property types listed in the spec are present in property_types
- Any missing types have been added with correct schema (name, description, units, data_type)

This completes the first step in the ChEMBL property types remediation process. The next step is to update the ChEMBL_Integrated_Import.py script to implement fallback logic for unknown property types (task-imp-chembl-property-types-002).
