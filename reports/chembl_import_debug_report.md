# ChEMBL Import Debug Report

## Summary

The ChEMBL data import script (`database/population/chembl_import.py`) runs but fails to store data in the database. This report documents the investigation, findings, and fixes for the database interaction issues.

## Investigation Approach

1. Analyzed the execution report (`reports/chembl_import_execution_report.md`)
2. Examined the ChEMBL import script (`database/population/chembl_import.py`)
3. Reviewed the MCP adapter implementation (`database/adapters/mcp.py`)
4. Created a test script to isolate and verify database interaction issues
5. Fixed the identified issues in the ChEMBL import script

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. MCP Tool Import Issue

The script imports `use_mcp_tool` directly, which may not be correctly set up:

```python
from use_mcp_tool import use_mcp_tool
```

The MCPAdapter class in `database/adapters/mcp.py` has a more robust import mechanism that tries to import from the global namespace and falls back to a local implementation.

### 2. Parameter Handling Mismatch

The script uses positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.) in SQL queries:

```python
query = """
INSERT INTO molecules 
    (chembl_id, name, smiles, inchi, inchikey, formula, molecular_weight, data_source)
VALUES 
    ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8)
ON CONFLICT (chembl_id) DO UPDATE SET
    name = EXCLUDED.name,
    ...
"""
```

However, the MCPAdapter handles parameters by replacing placeholders (%s or %(name)s) with formatted values. This mismatch causes the SQL queries to fail.

### 3. Lack of Transaction Handling

The script doesn't use explicit transactions. Each SQL operation is executed independently, which could lead to partial data insertion if some operations succeed and others fail.

### 4. Error Handling Issues

The `execute_sql` function catches exceptions but returns an empty list on error:

```python
def execute_sql(project_id: str, query: str, params: Optional[List[Any]] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    try:
        # ...
        result = use_mcp_tool("supabase", "execute_sql", arguments)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error executing SQL query: {str(e)}")
        logger.debug(traceback.format_exc())
        return []  # Returns empty list on error
```

This masks critical issues and makes it difficult to diagnose problems.

### 5. Result Verification Issues

The script doesn't verify that the database operations actually modified rows. It checks if a result is returned but doesn't confirm that rows were affected.

## Test Script Results

A test script was created to isolate and verify the database interaction issues. The script confirmed:

1. Basic connectivity to the Supabase database works
2. The MCP tool can execute simple SELECT queries
3. Parameter handling is the primary issue - positional parameters ($1, $2) are not properly processed
4. Transactions need to be explicitly managed

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed MCP Tool Import**: Updated the import mechanism to be more robust and handle import errors gracefully.

2. **Fixed Parameter Handling**: Modified SQL queries to use the correct parameter format (%s or %(name)s) that the MCP adapter expects.

3. **Added Transaction Handling**: Implemented explicit transaction handling to ensure all operations succeed or fail together.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling to properly propagate errors and provide more detailed diagnostics.

5. **Added Result Verification**: Added checks to verify that database operations actually modified rows.

## Verification

After implementing the fixes, the script was tested with a small batch of molecules. The verification confirmed:

1. Molecules are successfully inserted into the database
2. Properties are correctly associated with molecules
3. The verification step shows the expected number of molecules in the database

## Conclusion

The primary issue was a mismatch between the parameter format used in the SQL queries and the parameter handling in the MCP adapter. By fixing this issue and improving transaction handling and error reporting, the ChEMBL import script now successfully stores data in the database.

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Database Interaction**: Use a consistent approach for database interactions across all scripts, preferably using the MCPAdapter class directly.

2. **Implement Integration Tests**: Create integration tests that verify database operations work correctly with the MCP adapter.

3. **Enhance Error Reporting**: Add more detailed error reporting to help diagnose issues more quickly in the future.

4. **Document MCP Adapter Usage**: Create documentation on how to properly use the MCP adapter, especially regarding parameter handling and transaction management.
