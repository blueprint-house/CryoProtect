# ChEMBL Import Execution Report

## Summary

The ChEMBL data import script was executed successfully, but encountered issues with database operations. While the script processed molecules and attempted to insert them into the database, the verification step showed that no molecules were actually stored in the database.

## Execution Details

- **Date:** May 1, 2025
- **Script:** `database/population/chembl_import.py`
- **Target:** Import at least 5,000 molecules
- **Actual Result:** 20 molecules processed, 0 molecules verified in database
- **Property Completeness:** 0.0%

## Process Overview

1. The script successfully initialized and connected to the ChEMBL API
2. It loaded a checkpoint from a previous run showing 20 molecules already imported
3. The script performed similarity searches using reference SMILES strings
4. It then performed keyword searches for cryoprotectant-related terms
5. The script attempted to insert molecules using the Supabase MCP tool
6. The verification step showed 0 molecules in the database

## Issues Identified

1. **Database Operation Failure:** While the script executed SQL queries to insert molecules, the verification step showed that no molecules were actually stored in the database. This suggests issues with:
   - Supabase MCP tool connectivity
   - Transaction handling
   - Permissions or authentication issues
   - Possible schema mismatches

2. **Property Import Failure:** No molecular properties were imported, resulting in 0% property completeness.

## Success Criteria Status

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Molecule Count | ≥5,000 | 0 | ❌ Not Met |
| Reference Compounds | 9 | 0 | ❌ Not Met |
| Property Completeness | ≥90% | 0% | ❌ Not Met |

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Database Connectivity:** Verify that the Supabase MCP tool is correctly configured and has proper permissions to insert data.

2. **Check Transaction Handling:** Ensure that database transactions are being properly committed.

3. **Validate SQL Queries:** Review the SQL queries being executed to ensure they match the database schema.

4. **Test with Direct Database Access:** Try executing a simple insert operation directly against the database to verify connectivity.

5. **Review Checkpoint Mechanism:** The script loaded a checkpoint indicating 20 molecules were previously imported, but verification found none. This suggests the checkpoint data may be inaccurate.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the database connectivity and transaction handling issues
2. Retry the import with a smaller batch to verify the fix
3. Once successful, run the full import to meet the target of 5,000 molecules
