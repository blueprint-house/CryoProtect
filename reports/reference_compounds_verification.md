# Reference Compounds Verification Report

**Date:** April 29, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

## Executive Summary

The database contains most of the reference cryoprotectant compounds, but with significant issues:

1. **ChEMBL ID Linking:** None of the reference compounds are linked to their ChEMBL IDs
2. **Compound Coverage:** 5 out of 7 reference compounds are present (71.4% coverage)
3. **Property Completeness:** Only 1 out of 5 found reference compounds has additional properties (20% completeness)
4. **Basic Data Quality:** Excellent - 722 out of 723 molecules have complete basic data (99.86% completeness)

| Cell Permeability | 0.85 | μm/s |

## Recommendations

1. **Link Existing Molecules to ChEMBL IDs**
   - Update the molecules table to include ChEMBL IDs for the reference compounds that are already in the database

2. **Import Missing Reference Compounds**
   - Import Aspirin and Caffeine into the database

3. **Add Properties for All Reference Compounds**
   - Populate the molecular_properties table with properties for Glycerol, Ethylene glycol, Trehalose, and D-Glucose

4. **Ensure Consistent Naming and Identification**
   - Standardize the naming and identification of compounds across different data sources

## Conclusion

The database contains most of the reference cryoprotectant compounds, but they are not properly linked to their ChEMBL IDs and most of them lack additional properties. While the basic molecular data is complete for almost all molecules, the additional properties that are important for cryoprotectant analysis are largely missing. Only Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has a complete set of properties.

The database would benefit from linking existing molecules to their ChEMBL IDs, importing missing reference compounds, and enriching all reference compounds with additional properties.
