# CryoProtect v2 - Database Integrity Remediation

This document outlines the database integrity remediation process for CryoProtect v2, addressing critical issues identified in the database integrity report.

## Issues Addressed

The remediation addresses the following critical issues:

1. **Empty molecule table** (HIGH severity)
2. **Orphaned records** in the following tables:
   - `mixture_component` (referencing non-existent molecules)
   - `molecular_property` (referencing non-existent molecules)
   - `prediction` (referencing non-existent molecules)

## Remediation Scripts

Two scripts have been created to address these issues:

### 1. `remediate_database_integrity.py`

This is the main remediation script that:

- Repopulates the `molecule` table using the existing `populate_molecules.py` script
- Identifies and removes orphaned records in the dependent tables
- Verifies database integrity after remediation
- Generates a detailed remediation summary

**Usage:**
```bash
python remediate_database_integrity.py [--dry-run]
```

**Options:**
- `--dry-run`: Run in dry-run mode (no changes made, only report what would be done)

### 2. `run_database_remediation.py`

This is a wrapper script that:

- Runs the remediation process
- Displays a user-friendly summary of the actions taken
- Shows the verification results

**Usage:**
```bash
python run_database_remediation.py [--dry-run]
```

**Options:**
- `--dry-run`: Run in dry-run mode (no changes made, only report what would be done)

## Remediation Process

The remediation process follows these steps:

1. **Repopulate the molecule table**
   - Uses the existing `populate_molecules.py` script
   - Adds scientifically accurate cryoprotectant data with proper chemical identifiers

2. **Remove orphaned records**
   - Identifies records in dependent tables that reference non-existent molecules
   - Removes these orphaned records to restore referential integrity

3. **Verify database integrity**
   - Runs the existing `verify_database_integrity.py` script
   - Confirms that all tables have data and foreign key relationships are valid

## Output Files

The remediation process generates the following output files:

- `database_remediation.log`: Detailed log of the remediation process
- `reports/database_remediation_summary.json`: JSON summary of actions taken and results
- `reports/database_integrity_report.json`: Updated database integrity report after remediation

## Example Usage

To run the remediation in dry-run mode first (recommended):

```bash
python run_database_remediation.py --dry-run
```

To apply the remediation:

```bash
python run_database_remediation.py
```

## Troubleshooting

If the remediation fails, check the following:

1. **Environment variables**: Ensure that `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_USER`, and `SUPABASE_PASSWORD` are set correctly in the `.env` file.

2. **Authentication**: Verify that the provided Supabase credentials have sufficient permissions to modify the database.

3. **Log files**: Check `database_remediation.log` for detailed error messages.

4. **Database access**: Ensure that the database is accessible and that there are no network issues.

## Manual Verification

After running the remediation, you can manually verify the results by:

1. Checking that the `molecule` table is populated
2. Confirming that there are no orphaned records in the dependent tables
3. Reviewing the `reports/database_integrity_report.json` file to ensure all checks pass

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the remediation process:

1. Add support for restoring orphaned records instead of just removing them
2. Implement more sophisticated data validation for the molecule table
3. Add monitoring to prevent future integrity issues
