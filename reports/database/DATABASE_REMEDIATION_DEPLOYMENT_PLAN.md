# CryoProtect v2 - Database Remediation Deployment Plan

This document outlines the plan for deploying the database remediation across different environments (development, staging, and production).

## Overview

The database remediation process should be deployed in a phased approach across environments to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition. The general flow is:

1. Development → 2. Staging → 3. Production

## Prerequisites for All Environments

Before deploying to any environment, ensure:

1. A full database backup has been created
2. All application code that interacts with the database is available for testing
3. The necessary permissions are in place to execute the remediation scripts
4. A rollback plan is in place (see DATABASE_REMEDIATION_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md)

## Deployment to Development Environment

### Preparation

1. Notify all developers that the database remediation will be taking place
2. Schedule the remediation during a time when development activity is low
3. Create a full backup of the development database

### Execution

1. Run the remediation process in dry-run mode first:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 2: "Run in dry-run mode"

2. Review the logs and address any issues

3. Run the complete remediation process:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 1: "Run complete database remediation"

### Validation

1. Run the verification process:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 3: "Run verification only"

2. Test all application functionality that interacts with the database
3. Have developers test their specific features

### Post-Deployment

1. Update development documentation to reflect the new database structure
2. Notify developers of the changes and provide guidance on updating their code

## Deployment to Staging Environment

### Preparation

1. Ensure the remediation was successful in the development environment
2. Schedule the remediation during a time when staging is not being used for testing
3. Create a full backup of the staging database
4. Notify all stakeholders who use the staging environment

### Execution

1. Run the remediation process in dry-run mode first:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 2: "Run in dry-run mode"

2. Review the logs and address any issues

3. Run the complete remediation process:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 1: "Run complete database remediation"

### Validation

1. Run the verification process:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 3: "Run verification only"

2. Execute a full test suite against the staging environment
3. Perform load testing to ensure performance is acceptable
4. Have QA team verify all functionality

### Post-Deployment

1. Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
2. Update staging documentation to reflect the new database structure
3. Prepare for production deployment based on staging experience

## Deployment to Production Environment

### Preparation

1. Ensure the remediation was successful in both development and staging environments
2. Schedule the remediation during a maintenance window with minimal user impact
3. Create multiple backups of the production database (at least 3 separate backups)
4. Notify all users of the planned maintenance
5. Have a rollback plan ready (see DATABASE_REMEDIATION_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md)
6. Assemble a deployment team with clear roles and responsibilities

### Execution

1. Run the remediation process in dry-run mode first:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 2: "Run in dry-run mode"

2. Review the logs and address any issues

3. Run the remediation process one phase at a time:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 4: "Run a specific phase"
   
   Execute phases in order (1-5), validating after each phase

### Validation

1. Run the verification process:
   ```
   database_remediation_quickstart.bat
   ```
   Select option 3: "Run verification only"

2. Execute a full test suite against the production environment
3. Monitor system performance closely
4. Have key users verify critical functionality

### Post-Deployment

1. Monitor the system for 24-48 hours for any issues
2. Document the deployment process and any issues encountered
3. Update production documentation to reflect the new database structure
4. Conduct a post-deployment review meeting

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are encountered during deployment to any environment, follow the rollback procedure outlined in DATABASE_REMEDIATION_ROLLBACK_PLAN.md.

## Communication Plan

### Development Deployment

- Notify: All developers
- Method: Email, team chat
- Timing: 24 hours before deployment
- Follow-up: Team meeting to discuss changes

### Staging Deployment

- Notify: All developers, QA team, product managers
- Method: Email, team chat, calendar invite
- Timing: 48 hours before deployment
- Follow-up: QA report, team meeting

### Production Deployment

- Notify: All staff, customers (if applicable)
- Method: Email, system notification, status page
- Timing: 1 week before deployment
- Follow-up: Status update, post-deployment report

## Timeline

| Environment | Estimated Duration | Recommended Window |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Development | 2-4 hours | Weekday evening |
| Staging | 4-6 hours | Weekend |
| Production | 6-8 hours | Weekend maintenance window |

## Success Criteria

The deployment is considered successful when:

1. All verification steps pass
2. Application functionality works as expected
3. No critical issues are reported within 48 hours
4. Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
