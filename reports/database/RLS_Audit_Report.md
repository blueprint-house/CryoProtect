# Row Level Security (RLS) Audit Report - CryoProtect v2

## Executive Summary

The CryoProtect v2 database audit revealed that initially, 6 out of 11 tables were empty, and there were 20 foreign key relationship issues and completeness issues in 5 tables. After remediation, all tables are populated. There are 13 remaining integrity issues related to column naming, but no actual data problems. The database now contains scientifically accurate data for molecules, mixtures, experiments, and predictions, with proper relationships established between them. Recommendations for further enhancement include adding more mixture components, expanding calculation methods, creating team memberships, adding more projects, and implementing data validation.

The security implementation includes enabling Row Level Security (RLS) on all public tables, creating RLS policies for different access patterns, implementing app-specific database roles with minimum permissions, and providing verification and rollback mechanisms. RLS was enabled on tables like molecules, mixtures, and experiments. Policies were created to allow public read access based on the `is_public` flag and to provide owner full access.

## Current RLS Status Overview

The following table shows the current RLS status and policy count for all tables in the CryoProtect v2 database:

## Detailed Analysis of Existing Policies

### Policy Implementation Patterns

The RLS implementation in CryoProtect v2 follows several consistent patterns:

1. **Project-based Access Control**: Most tables use project membership as the primary access control mechanism. Policies check if the authenticated user is a member of the project associated with the record.

2. **Role-based Permissions**: Some tables (like `project` and `team`) implement role-based permissions, where certain operations (like DELETE) are restricted to users with specific roles (e.g., 'owner').

3. **Service Role Bypass**: All tables have policies allowing the service role to bypass RLS restrictions, which is necessary for data population scripts and administrative functions.

4. **Audit Trail**: The improved implementation adds a comprehensive audit trail for scientific data, tracking all changes with user information and context.

### Core Policy Types

The following policy types are implemented across the database:

1. **SELECT Policies**: Allow users to view records based on project or team membership.
2. **INSERT Policies**: Allow users to add new records to projects or teams they belong to.
3. **UPDATE Policies**: Allow users to modify records in their projects or teams.
4. **DELETE Policies**: Allow users to remove records, sometimes restricted to specific roles.
5. **Service Role Policies**: Allow the service role to perform all operations regardless of other restrictions.

### Security Invoker Views

The implementation uses `SECURITY INVOKER` views to ensure that views respect the RLS policies of their underlying tables. This is applied to:

- `molecule_with_properties`
- `mixture_with_components`
- `experiment_with_results`

### Performance Optimizations

The improved implementation includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Indexes for RLS**: Specific indexes are created for columns used in RLS policy conditions to improve query performance.
2. **Optimized View Definitions**: The views are optimized to minimize joins and improve query performance.
3. **Conditional Policy Creation**: Policies are only created if they don't already exist, preventing duplicate policies.

## Policy Gaps and Inconsistencies

Based on the analysis, the following gaps and inconsistencies have been identified:

### 1. RLS Disabled but Policies Exist

Several tables have RLS disabled but still have policies defined:

- `calculation_methods`: 3 policies
- `predictions`: 4 policies
- `property_types`: 3 policies

This creates a confusing situation where policies exist but are not enforced.

### 2. RLS Enabled but Missing Policies

Several tables have RLS enabled but are missing expected policies:

- `experiment_properties`: Only 2 policies instead of the expected 4
- `mixture_components`: Only 6 policies instead of the expected 8
- `mixtures`: Only 7 policies instead of the expected 8
- `molecular_properties`: Only 6 policies instead of the expected 8
- `molecule_experiments`: Only 4 policies instead of the expected 8
- `molecule_proteins`: Only 4 policies instead of the expected 8
- `molecules`: Only 7 policies instead of the expected 8
- `proteins`: Only 3 policies instead of the expected 8

This could lead to unintended access restrictions or security vulnerabilities.

### 3. RLS Disabled and No Policies

Some critical tables have RLS disabled and no policies defined:

- `projects`: 0 policies
- `teams`: 0 policies
- `user_profile`: 0 policies

This is particularly concerning for tables containing user information and project/team definitions, as they may expose sensitive data.

### 4. Inconsistent Policy Implementation

The policy implementation is inconsistent across tables:

- Some tables use direct user ID checks (`user_profile`)
- Others use complex joins to verify project or team membership
- Some tables have role-based restrictions for certain operations, while others don't

### 5. Missing Public Access Policies

Despite the executive summary mentioning "policies to allow public read access based on the `is_public` flag", no such policies were found in the implementation. This suggests a gap between the intended and actual implementation.

## Recommendations for Policy Enhancements

Based on the identified gaps and inconsistencies, the following enhancements are recommended:

### 1. Enable RLS on All Tables

RLS should be enabled on all tables to ensure consistent security enforcement:

- `calculation_methods`
- `predictions`
- `projects`
- `property_types`
- `teams`
- `user_profile`

### 2. Complete Missing Policies

Add the missing policies to tables with incomplete policy sets:

- Add DELETE and UPDATE policies to `experiment_properties`
- Add service role policies to `mixture_components`, `mixtures`, `molecular_properties`, `molecules`
- Add complete policy sets to `molecule_experiments`, `molecule_proteins`, `proteins`

### 3. Implement Public Access Policies

Add policies to allow public read access based on the `is_public` flag as mentioned in the executive summary:

- Add SELECT policies that check the `is_public` flag for relevant tables (molecules, mixtures, experiments)

### 4. Standardize Policy Implementation

Standardize the policy implementation across all tables:

- Use consistent naming conventions for policies
- Implement consistent role-based restrictions for sensitive operations
- Ensure all tables have the same level of protection for equivalent operations

### 5. Add Data Classification Policies

Implement data classification-based policies for sensitive scientific data:

- Add policies that restrict access to highly sensitive data based on user clearance levels
- Implement time-based access restrictions for embargoed research data

### 6. Enhance Audit Trail

Extend the audit trail implementation to cover all tables, not just scientific data:

- Add audit triggers to user management tables
- Implement periodic audit log reviews

CREATE POLICY "Restrict access to sensitive molecular data"
  ON molecular_property
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    (sensitivity_level IS NULL OR sensitivity_level <= 'medium') OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_profile
      WHERE user_profile.user_id = auth.uid()
      AND user_profile.clearance_level >= molecular_property.sensitivity_level
    )
  );
COMMENT ON POLICY "Restrict access to sensitive molecular data" ON molecular_property IS
  'Restricts access to sensitive molecular data based on user clearance level.';
```

## Conclusion

The RLS implementation in CryoProtect v2 provides a solid foundation for data security but has several gaps and inconsistencies that need to be addressed. By implementing the recommended enhancements, the security posture of the database can be significantly improved, ensuring that sensitive scientific data is properly protected while still allowing appropriate access for collaboration and research.

The most critical issues to address are:

1. Enabling RLS on all tables, particularly those containing user information and project/team definitions
2. Completing the missing policies for tables with RLS enabled
3. Implementing public access policies based on the `is_public` flag
4. Standardizing the policy implementation across all tables

These improvements will ensure that the CryoProtect v2 database meets best practices for security and access control in a collaborative scientific environment.
